## Description

Within the Destination Earth (DestinE) initiative, this project, managed by RHEA Group (RHEA) with the collaboration of Trust-IT Services (Trust-IT) and the Aristotle University of Thessalonik (AUTh), aims at developing a set of use cases to be procured via ESA Best Practice to demonstrate the capabilities of DestinE in general and DESP in particular.
