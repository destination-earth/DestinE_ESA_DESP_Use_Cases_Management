The DestinE Community Management Strategy and Workplan (CBMS) is the
document that outlines expectations and procedures for implementing an
open stakeholder dialogue within the ESA DestinE Use Cases project
(DEUC), in accordance with the DestinE Partnership Plan.

This current version (V6.0) is the 5th official iteration of the D2.2
Community Building and Management Strategy crystallising the living
document updates following feedback received as well as updates based on
experience in implementing the strategy and plan.

In Section 2, targeted stakeholders are mapped and categorised.

Section 3, consists of the DestinE Community Building Strategy which
outlines the approach to effectively build, engage and manage the
DestinE User Community while nurturing the ground for the successful
exploitation of DestinE Platoform capabilities, applications, and
solutions by the users.

# DestinE Overview and Target Stakeholders

## Destination Earth

DestinE is an initiative of the European Commission to **develop a
highly-accurate digital twin of Earth** to model, monitor, and simulate
natural and human activity Earth System phenomena and natural hazards to
develop and test scenarios that will assist policy-makers in designing
accurate and actionable adaptation strategies and mitigation measures
for achieving both the [[Green
Deal]{.underline}](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en)
and the [[Digital
Strategy]{.underline}](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strategy_en)
priorities of the EU:

- **DestinE will anticipate both natural disasters and man-made
  environmental damage** with ever higher accuracy. It will identify and
  assess the negative impacts of natural disasters and environmental
  damage on various socio-economic sectors and geographical regions. In
  other words, DestinE will integrate 'cause and effect' -- combining
  better forecasts of potential environmental disasters with their
  expected adverse impacts on human activity.

- **DestinE will enable the continuous and accurate monitoring of the
  health of the planet** by focusing on the countless effects of climate
  change on, e.g., the oceans, water resources, the Earth's ice caps,
  biodiversity, land use, and other natural resources.

- **DestinE will allow to better understand the socio-economic effects
  of climate change and the occurrence of extreme natural disasters**.
  For example, between 1980 and 2017, floods, droughts, heat waves and
  other climate-related extremes caused economic losses in excess of
  €420 billion and have claimed the lives of more than 115,000 people
  across Europe.

- **DestinE will help adapting to climate change related challenges** by
  providing a common **infrastructure for the users at various levels**
  for supporting informed and actionable decision-making for policy
  measures, for example, to assess the real impact and efficiency of
  environmental policies and related legislative measures.

In the Commission's Data Strategy of 2020, DestinE is highlighted as an
initiative that will cover concrete actions in the context of the Green
Deal Data Space and in support of the Green Deal objectives.

DestinE will be implemented gradually over the next 7-10 years. The
activities funded by the [[DIGITAL Work Progamme
2021-2022]{.underline}](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/work-programmes-digital)
will focus on the deployment of the Core Service Platform and the Data
Lake, the building of the Digital Twin Engine and the implementation of
the first two Digital Twins on Weather-induced & Geophysical Extremes
and on Climate Change Adaptation that will be integrated into the
platform. In later stages, these initial components will be complemented
by additional digital twins, tools and applications by research
institutions, private sector and civil society. Additional funding will
be available from other sources, e.g., the Horizon Europe Programme.

DestinE will also have a clear interface with the European Union's
flagship Space programme Copernicus and its relevant resources.

## Stakeholder Mapping

The DestinE stakeholders will contribute to the design and development
of the system through a co-design process to ensure that the system
responds to real user needs and provides novelty in comparison to their
current operational environments.

Considering the size and goals of the DestinE initiative, the user
community shall be composed of multiple and diverse types of
stakeholders.

Based on the insights from Baulenas, et. Al, (2023), the significance of
stakeholder engagement extends beyond mere categorization, emphasizing
the depth of interaction. Stakeholders should be differentiated by their
engagement levels, including terms like \"superusers,\"
\"companion-partner users,\" \"fellow users,\" \"champion users,\" and
\"next users\". The role also of influential stakeholders, such as
highly regarded scientists or policy intermediaries, is pivotal. These
individuals or entities, can sponsor projects, serving as connectors
within social networks and inspiring broader participation. Furthermore,
engaging intermediary organizations like community-based groups can
ensure the engagement process remains equitable and transparent,
preventing the marginalization of certain communities. Thus, the
categorization of the stakeholders should take into account:

- The stakeholder\'s contribution to the service\'s success.

- The stakeholder\'s interest in the service.

- The resources (e.g., finances, expertise, local knowledge) the
  stakeholder offers.

- The impact of some stakeholders on the engagement of others.

- Barriers to meaningful engagement.

- The service\'s capacity to manage increasing disaster severity.

- The inclusivity of diverse perspectives and stakeholder groups.

- Representation of diverse demographics and marginalized groups.

- The stakeholder\'s network access that could enhance service uptake.

For the current stage of DestinE and before the system launch, the
classification of the stakeholders for the stakeholders' mapping will be
based on three different levels, the spatial, their expertise, and the
customised one. Upon system release, the stakeholders/users will be
further categorized by their usage levels as follows:

- Leaders (DG-CNECT)

- Co - developers (ESA-ECMWF-EUMETSAT)

- Creators (EE\'s contractors & partners)

- Consumers (policy/decision makers)

- All other DestinE Users

The spatial categorisation will be used for policy and decision makers,
while the expertise will apply to the research and academia, technology
providers, and industry. For these two categories, a Power-Interest
matrix will better define the recommended targeting and value
propositions.

This classification enables focused engagement tactics by matching the
influence and interest of each stakeholder group in DestinE. Because
their activity mostly relies on access to DestinE\'s data, subjects are
mapped as high-interest but low-power stakeholders because they lack the
institutional clout to direct the project. Because of their dual roles
as important contributors and beneficiaries, players are positioned at
the centre of the effort, playing a crucial role in both influencing and
benefiting from DestinE. Context Setters are very powerful in their
domains, but because of their lack of alignment with DestinE\'s current
focus, engaging them requires special efforts. Lastly, the Crowd\'s
marginal significance to DestinE defines it, so engagement tactics focus
on increasing awareness and offering easy-to-use tools to encourage
involvement.

The DestinE Use case makers, the Core DestinE Entities, and the general
public have a special classification of their own, as they apply to
different categorisations and peculiarities. A visual representation of
the above stakeholders' categories is seen in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Stakeholder categorisation

### Categorisation based on a spatial scale

Using a spatial approach to generate a stakeholders\' map is important
for several reasons. First, different stakeholders may have different
levels of interest and influence depending on the spatial scale. For
example, local stakeholders such as community groups and NGOs may be
more influential at the local and regional scales, while national
governments and international organisations may have more influence at
the national and global scales. By considering stakeholders at different
spatial scales, the DestinE initiative can ensure that it is engaging
with the right stakeholders at the right levels of decision-making.
Second, DestinE aims to provide insights and solutions that are
applicable at different spatial scales. For example, the project may
provide local decision-makers with information and tools to improve
disaster risk management and adaptation, while also providing global
decision-makers with information on the impacts of the climate crisis on
a global scale. By considering stakeholders at different spatial scales,
the project can ensure that the insights and solutions it provides are
relevant and applicable to different decision-makers and contexts.
Moreover, considering stakeholders at different spatial scales can help
to identify potential conflicts and trade-offs between different
stakeholders and scales. By considering stakeholders at different
spatial scales, DestinE can identify potential conflicts and work to
develop solutions that are beneficial at multiple scales. Last but not
least, engaging stakeholders at an ecoregion level is expected to be
vital, considering that areas that are identified as similar require a
similar course of action.

#### Policymakers

Policymakers, including representatives from government agencies and
international organisations, may be interested in using the data and
insights to inform policy development and implementation. They may have
a strong interest in understanding the impacts of the climate crisis and
extreme weather events, and how they can be mitigated and adapted to.
Policymakers are key stakeholders and main beneficiaries of the DestinE
initiative, as it provides them with a powerful and unique tool for
analysis and prediction, to make data-driven policy decisions. As the EU
works toward its goal of being carbon neutral by 2050, DestinE
initiative will serve as the foundation for successful European
adaptation strategies in support of the European Commission's.

Policymakers are considered key users of the DestinE Platform. Thus,
policymakers\' needs identification is critical. Their specific
classification is shown in Figure 2 and may occur as follows:

- **Local policymakers**: city councils, local governments responsible
  for managing natural resources, local environmental agencies i.e.,
  environmental protection departments.

- **Regional policymakers**: regional authorities responsible for
  managing natural resources i.e., regional councils for the environment
  and sustainable development.

- **National policymakers**: national ministries of environment,
  national meteorological and hydrological services, members of
  parliament, officials from relevant national departments, and civil
  protection services, emergency services.

- **Continental scale policymakers**: European Emergency Coordination
  Center, European Commission\'s Directorate-General for climate action,
  the European Environment Agency, members of the European Parliament,
  representatives of the European Commission and other EU bodies,
  officials from intergovernmental organisations operating at the
  continental level, representatives of national governments and
  authorities.

- **Ecoregions policymakers**: representatives of organisations working
  at the level of the 14 major ecoregions.

- **Global scale policymakers**: representatives of the United Nations
  and its agencies, officials from intergovernmental organisations
  working at the global level, and representatives of international NGOs
  working on global issues.

breakdown](./D2.2/images/media/image5.png){width="4.312723097112861in"
height="3.234782370953631in"}

**[Subjects]{.underline}**

- **Local:** Local policymakers, including city councils, local
  governments, and environmental agencies, hold limited power within
  their jurisdiction but demonstrate high interest in DestinE. For these
  actors, the platform offers practical tools to manage natural
  resources, address environmental challenges, and plan sustainable
  urban development. For instance, DestinE data can inform strategies
  for local climate resilience or disaster preparedness.

- **Regional:** Regional authorities have moderate influence within
  their territories and display strong interest in DestinE\'s
  capabilities. Regional councils for the environment and sustainable
  development can use DestinE to harmonise resource management across
  municipalities, fostering collaboration and improving ecological
  outcomes. DestinE offers an integrative approach to regional
  challenges such as water resource management or biodiversity
  protection.

- **Ecoregional:** At the ecoregion level, policymakers represent
  organisations focused on specific biogeographical areas. With
  significant interest but limited power, these actors can leverage
  DestinE to align their conservation policies with data-driven insights
  and better articulate the needs of their unique ecological systems to
  larger-scale stakeholders.

**[Players]{.underline}**

- **National:** National policymakers, including ministries, parliament
  members, and emergency services, are central players due to their
  significant power and high interest in DestinE. The platform offers
  unparalleled data for crafting national climate adaptation policies,
  disaster risk management strategies, and environmental regulations.
  Additionally, DestinE enables more informed decision-making for
  hydrological services and civil protection agencies, enhancing
  national resilience to climate impacts.

- **Continental:** Policymakers at this level, such as the European
  Commission\'s Directorate-General for Climate Action and the European
  Environment Agency, wield considerable power and exhibit strong
  interest in DestinE. As stewards of EU-wide climate policies and
  programmes, they can use DestinE to harmonise climate action across
  member states, monitor compliance, and support policy design informed
  by cutting-edge simulations and data integration. DestinE\'s
  validation through use cases also builds trust among these actors,
  further cementing its role as a cornerstone of EU climate initiatives.

**[Context Setters]{.underline}**

- **Global:** Global policymakers, such as representatives of UN
  agencies and international NGOs, hold substantial influence but have a
  broader focus, placing them in the Context Setter quadrant as their
  engagement with DestinE is often indirect. However, as DestinE proves
  its value in regional and national contexts, it has the potential to
  shape global climate policy discussions and inform frameworks for
  international cooperation. Ensuring that these stakeholders understand
  the platform\'s potential will be crucial for DestinE\'s adoption on a
  global scale.

#### Decision makers

Decision makers, including high-level government officials and business
leaders, may have a strong interest in DestinE as it has the potential
to inform and guide policy decisions related to the twin, green and
digital transition. They may also be interested in the potential
economic benefits of the DestinE Platform, such as increased efficiency
and productivity, and job creation. Decision makers are also considered
key users of the DestinE Platformand their needs identification is
important.

Decision makers are likely to be key supporters of the DestinE
initiative, setting them as an early engagement stakeholder. Their
specific classification is shown in Figure 3 and may occur as follows:

- Local scale decision makers: city planners, business owners and
  managers, and community leaders, such as non-profit organisation
  leaders

- Regional scale decision makers: regional managers, chamber of commerce
  members, and representatives of non-governmental organisations

- National level decision makers: corporate executives, investment
  bankers, venture capitalists, and business leaders (e.g., CEOs, CTOs)

- Continental level decision makers: European business leaders,
  investors, representatives of intergovernmental organisations and
  representatives of regional development banks.

- Ecoregion decision makers: experts and practitioners with knowledge of
  specific ecoregions and their particular challenges and
  representatives of indigenous and other local communities.

- Global scale decision makers: global business CEOs and other
  executives of major global corporations, and representatives of
  international organisations focused on climate and the environment.

**[Subjects]{.underline}**

Both of the following may have power at the local level, but their
limited sphere of influence excludes them from being considered
"players" for the context of this analysis.

- **Local:** The different types of subjects at a local level have
  different levels of local power and different needs, but all of them
  with an elevated interest in the opportunities offered by DestinE;
  city planners will undoubtedly be interested in the simulation and
  planning capabilities of the system that will help them design more
  resilient and efficient spaces, community leaders can rally and focus
  on issues that are backed by the data in DestinE, and business owners
  can narrow and better protect their investments and activities.

- **Ecoregion:** This level includes both experts and practitioners of
  specific ecoregion systems as well as representatives of indigenous
  groups and other similar communities. For the first category, DestinE
  represents a major step forward in advancing their expertise as well
  as providing them with a platform to resonate with scientists and
  researchers. For the second, DestinE can be a tool to enhance their
  advocacy as well as to easily disseminate their collective knowledge
  on the subjects.

**[Players]{.underline}**

- **Continental:** At an international level, business leaders and
  investors have more to gain from the functionalities of DestinE and
  can benefit from its data to guide their investments in cross-national
  developments. This is even more true for representatives of
  intergovernmental organisations and regional development banks, whose
  work is directly connected to strengthening the growth and resilience
  of their competence areas regardless of national borders. DestinE will
  provide them with a uniquely valuable resource thanks to its core
  focus on international data and collaboration.

- **Global:** For representatives of large international organisations
  focused on climate/environment the appeal of DestinE is immediate and
  deep; the challenge is moreso ensuring that they are aware of it and
  the functionalities it affords them. In this way, DestinE will play a
  significant role in international climate-and-weather-related efforts
  throughout the world. As for executives and representatives of
  international corporations, though their work does not necessarily
  focus on the environment, the wealth of present and simulated
  information that DestinE brings to the table can make it a key
  decision-making tool for global investments, as well as guiding
  development & infrastructure strategies.

**[Context Setters]{.underline}**

- **Regional:** A category that might even be justifiably inserted in
  the Crowd quadrant, though kept in this one due to fluctuating levels
  of power depending on the specific context. Regional managers, chamber
  of commerce members, and NGO representatives will likely have low
  levels of interest for DestinE functionalities due to their limited
  role in environment/climate decision-making processes and the
  relatively low levels of relevance of these topics to their
  activities.

- **National:** The National level finds itself firmly in the Context
  Setter quadrant due to its inversely proportional levels of interest
  to power. Business leaders, corporate executives and venture
  capitalists shape the economy of their countries, yet their focus on
  inward development and dissociation from environmental and climate
  issues means that few of them will be interested in the opportunities
  that DestinE offers.

### Categorisation based on the area of expertise

#### Research and academia

Researchers and academics may be interested in using the data and tools
provided by DestinE Platformto advance scientific knowledge and
understanding of the earth. They may be interested in using DestinE
Platformto exchange knowledge, conduct research, validate models, and
test hypotheses. Research and academia are a key stakeholders and
beneficiaries of the DestinE platform, as access to the data used and
produced as part of the Digital Twins will provide researchers with the
tools to comprehend the intricate roles that the environment and people
will play in determining the earth's future, and open up a range of new
research questions.

Research and academia stakeholders can have different subcategories on
different spatial levels, depending on the focus of their research and
their geographical scope. However, in the case of the DestinE
initiative, the nature of the research and the digital twin approach
make it less relevant to differentiate between research and academia
stakeholders based on their spatial location. The research and academia
stakeholders involved in DestinE are likely to have expertise in
specific fields, such as climate science, hydrology, geology, and
atmospheric science, rather than being defined by their spatial
location. The same hydrologist, for example, may conduct research at a
local, regional, or global scale depending on their research focus and
the availability of data. Therefore, in the context of the DestinE
Platform, it may be more relevant to classify research and academia
stakeholders based on their areas of expertise rather than their spatial
location. Based on that, the research and academia classification may
include a vast variety of subcategories such as:

- Climate scientists

- Meteorologists

- Ecologists

- Hydrologists

- Environmental economists

- Social scientists

- Data scientists

- Environmental scientists

- Computer scientists

- Engineers

- Agronomists

- Biologists

subcategories

Figure 4 shows indicative subcategories of research and academia. For
each of these subcategories, the specific stakeholders involved may vary
depending on the spatial level in question. For example, at a local
level, climate scientists may include professors at a nearby university,
meteorologists may include forecasters at a local station, and
ecologists may include researchers at a nearby nature preserve. At a
national level, these stakeholders may include researchers at government
agencies, and at a global level, they may include scientists at
international research institutions. For the 14 major ecoregions,
specific stakeholders may include representatives from local
environmental NGOs, universities with research programs in the region,
and government agencies responsible for managing the region\'s natural
resources.

**[Subjects]{.underline}**

Data scientists, environmental scientists, and biologists usually work
in specialised or limited scientific fields and frequently lack the
institutional clout or decision-making power needed to impact major
projects like DestinE. Although their areas are relevant to Destination
Earth\'s objectives, they are not sufficiently aligned to directly
advance the project or make meaningful contributions. They have been
categorised into this quadrant due to the fact that they often operate
through institutions as advisors or members of teams that forward the
research to other expert groups that have more power. Individual
scientists in this field do not have much capacity, fiscal possibilities
to have power as a single entity but as a collective they serve more as
a connection between science and policy. 

This Group has a lot of potential to gain from DestinE, despite their
small impact. Giving Subjects access to top-notch data and resources so
they can further their studies and tackle novel scientific issues is one
of the main value propositions. Furthermore, these stakeholders can be
empowered to improve their abilities through customised
capacity-building efforts, like workshops and training courses in
high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), and
digital twin technologies. Through the development of cooperative
networks, DestinE can link these researchers with more prestigious
organisations, increasing the impact and quality of their research.

**[Players]{.underline}**

Climate scientists, meteorologists, ecologists, hydrologists, and
important engineers are essential to DestinE\'s success and are included
in the Players category. These stakeholders have significant influence
over the project and show a high degree of interest in it. They
frequently already participate in significant technical and research
initiatives that directly support DestinE\'s goals, so they not only
benefit from the platform but also help shape its future. Participants
are in a unique position to spur innovation, direct the project\'s
priorities, and guarantee that its results meet the most recent
legislative and scientific demands, such those of the European Green
Deal. The climate scientists, meteorologists, hydrologists and engineers
in the relevant field have a strong influence on the project because
they are often employed by consultant firms or political institutions to
directly advise the policymakers and with their strong interest and
knowledge and their close tie to the political institutions they are
able to leave an imprint and influence the policy-making process. 

The value propositions for Players are made to empower and acknowledge
their contributions because of how important they are. By collaborating
to establish research goals and making sure they are in line with global
issues, DestinE may provide these stakeholders with chances to influence
the initiative\'s vision. Through early access to its infrastructure,
information, and tools, DestinE can empower key stakeholders to lead
innovation in their domains and develop new applications.

**[Context Setters]{.underline}**

This category includes computer scientists, environmental economics, and
interdisciplinary social scientists. Due to a discrepancy between their
current focus and the main goals of DestinE, these stakeholders---who
frequently work at the forefront of their respective fields---are not
fully involved with the initiative. A social scientist might research
societal resilience, for instance, or a computer scientist might develop
algorithms for artificial intelligence, but their immediate interests
might not coincide with digital twin technologies or climate science.

DestinE should highlight value propositions that align with their
priorities and areas of expertise in order to get their attention.
Cross-disciplinary incentives, for example, can show how DestinE\'s
datasets and tools can address issues in their fields, including
improving AI models or evaluating the socioeconomic effects of climate
change. While demonstrating the compatibility of DestinE\'s data with
external platforms might highlight its usefulness in a variety of
applications beyond earth sciences, providing funding possibilities and
encouraging collaborative research projects can encourage their
participation. DestinE can increase its influence across disciplines and
open up new synergies by fostering their interest.

**[Crowd]{.underline}**

These stakeholders work in ancillary domains that are not closely
related to DestinE\'s primary areas of interest. Even if they are
currently not very involved, they could nevertheless use DestinE\'s data
and capabilities for secondary or niche applications. For example,
engineers may use DestinE\'s digital twin technology to solve certain
technological problems, while agronomists could use its climate data to
maximise crop yields. Engineers in a general sense and agronomists have
neither much power nor interest in DestinE, they have no touch points
with the topics and don't have the power, neither individually nor
collectively, to boost DestinE on a higher policy level or to bring it
to broader attention.

#### Technology providers

Technology providers, including companies that provide hardware and
software solutions, may be interested in both providing tools and
resources to support the development and implementation of DestinE and
to use the tools and resources provided by DestinE for their own
benefits. They may be interested in partnering with DestinE to provide
data processing and storage solutions, as well as analytical tools and
algorithms. Technology providers may be concerned about issues related
to data privacy and security, as well as the potential for competition
from other providers.

Technology providers may operate at all levels, from local to global.
However, their services and solutions may be more relevant and tailored
to specific spatial scales. For example, a GIS provider may focus more
on local and regional applications, while a remote sensing technology
provider may have a global reach. In the context of the DestinE project
it may be more relevant to classify technology providers based on the
services they provide rather than their spatial location. Ostensive the
following are referred:

- Geographic Information Systems (GIS) providers

- Remote sensing technology providers

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) providers

- Simulation and modelling software providers

- Visualisation and User Interface (UI) providers

- Cybersecurity and data privacy providers

- Cloud computing providers

- HPC providers

- Other software companies

- Hardware companies

![Figure 5 Indicative technology providers

height="3.498642825896763in"}

Figure 5 shows indicative subcategories of technology providers. Unlike
other stakeholder categories, technology providers do not have different
subcategories on different spatial levels because their services are not
necessarily limited to a specific geographic location. Technology
providers can provide their services globally, and their solutions can
be applied to various spatial scales. However, the specific solutions
they offer may vary based on the needs and characteristics of different
regions or ecosystems.

height="3.542361111111111in"}

**[Subjects]{.underline}**

- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS) providers:** Have the ability
  to visualise climate impacts, with comprehensive data sets from
  mapping and spatial analysis tools to inform adaptation and mitigation
  strategies. These providers may find the DestinE Platform useful to
  compare and contrast existing models and as supplementary support to
  their existing climate-related information.

- **Remote Sensing:** Utilise data to study and monitor the Earth's
  surface and oceans, which can be used to inform adaptation strategies,
  observe existing threats and prepare for future challenges. Remote
  sensing offers a unique approach to climate change and companies and
  individuals involved in remote sensing data development may be
  inclined to interact with DestinE as a way to confirm or reevaluate
  their own analyses.

- **Simulation & Modelling software providers:** Allow for experts to
  model cross-sector policies and strategies to better understand
  climate challenges and build a more resilient and sustainable society.
  These providers would want to use the DestinE Platform to reinforce
  their research and refine its performance in identified key areas.

- **Visualisation & User Interface (UI) providers:** Allow for
  decision-makers and key stakeholders to plot and identify trends to
  better understand existing and future risks. This knowledge is
  important in the policy-making process and these providers would want
  the DestinE Platform to act as a complementary tool for visualizing
  climate-related impacts and outcomes.

**[Players]{.underline}**

- **Software providers:** Have the capacity to develop technologies and
  solutions that can inform climate solutions and influence policy
  decision-making. Software providers would most likely be interested in
  learning about the unique features and components within the DestinE
  Platform to guide their own activities and perform tasks more
  effectively.

**[Context Setters]{.underline}**

- **HPC:** High Performace Computing (HPC) companies provide systems
  that can be used to research and develop solutions to combat
  climate-related challenges. While there is high-demand across
  industries to integrate these services for breakthrough results, HPC
  companies may not be interested in the already existing DestinE
  Platform other than to learn from its unique components and
  potentially identify areas for collaboration.

- **Cybersecurity and data privacy providers:** In the evolving and
  globalized digital landscape it is important to safeguard against data
  privacy threats and take the necessary steps to remain resilient to
  cyberattacks. Many sectors can become vulnerable to attacks when their
  company is suffering from climate-related challenges and consequences,
  therefore cybersecurity and data privacy provides may benefit from
  interacting with the DestinE Platform and gathering essential weather
  specific data to prevent attacks before they happen.

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML) providers:** AI
  and ML providers have the ability to supply multi-functional tools,
  like predictive modelling and pollution monitoring, that can tackle
  complex climate challenges and be an asset in planning and climate
  strategy implementation. These providers may be interested in learning
  from DestinE Platform and interacting with the broad range of
  stakeholders using the Platform to assist the development or
  modification of their own tools.

- **Cloud Computing:** Harnessing the power of cloud computing allows
  for decision-makers to gain more comprehensive knowledge about how to
  build a climate resilient world. Cloud computing is in high demand and
  companies are gaining political influence, they may only inspect the
  DestinE Platform to learn about how it functions and its specific
  capabilities.

**[Crowd]{.underline}**

- **Hardware providers:** Can offer reliable tools to enhance
  productivity and output that can be used for climate change research
  and analysis. However, while hardware components and units may be
  inherently innovative, their influence and effectiveness is determined
  and validated by the types of integrations they have with software
  systems. DestinE Platform services may not provide the relevant data
  and capabilities to influence their development and business
  behaviors.

#### Industry

Industry, including companies such as energy, agriculture, and
transportation, amongst many others may be interested in using the data
and insights offered by DestinE Platformto inform their operations and
decision-making. They may be interested in understanding the impacts of
climate crisis and extreme weather events on their business, as well as
identifying opportunities for innovation and growth. Industry, although
not necessarily one of the main beneficiaries, still has a lot to gain
from the initiative, as a digital twin (or twins) of the earth could
lead to innovations in risk management, insurance services, consulting,
real estate, journalism and media, organisation, transport, and even
other sectors where a benefit is less apparent.

Industry stakeholders may not be categorised based on different
subcategories on a spatial scale, as their interests and operations are
not necessarily confined to a specific geographic area. These companies
may operate at a local, regional, national, or global level, depending
on their industry and market reach. Many sectors could be interested and
will be able to join the community. An indicative categorisation is
shown in Figure 6 and listed below:

- **Energy and utility companies**: Those that may be interested in the
  potential impact of the climate crisis on energy supply and demand, as
  well as the opportunities presented by new weather forecasting
  technologies i.e., those involved in the production, distribution,
  and/or sale of energy, including those that work with fossil fuels,
  renewable energy, and nuclear power.

- **Agriculture and food companies**: Climate crisis will have a major
  impact on agricultural productivity, and companies associated with
  that may need to adapt to new conditions to maintain supply chains.
  Companies of the specific subgroup include those that produce crops,
  livestock, timber, and other related products.

- **Insurance and finance companies**: This subcategory contains
  companies that may be interested in the potential financial risks
  associated with climate crisis and extreme weather events. Examples of
  such companies are the ones that provide insurance against weather and
  climate-related risks, such as flooding, hurricanes, and wildfires.

- **Transportation companies**: Climate crisis and extreme weather
  events will have significant impacts on transportation infrastructure,
  particularly in coastal areas. Companies in this subcategory include
  airlines, shipping companies, and logistics providers.

- **Construction and real estate companies**: Construction and real
  estate companies that may need to adapt to changing weather conditions
  and sea levels, particularly in vulnerable areas. Such companies are
  the ones involved in the construction, maintenance, and management of
  infrastructure, including roads, bridges, airports, and utilities.

- **Consumer goods companies**: The specific subgroup refers to
  companies that may need to adapt to changing consumer preferences in
  response to climate crisis and extreme weather events, as well as
  potential supply chain disruptions. These companies may be the ones
  that sell products to consumers, including those that are focused on
  sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint.

height="2.9922419072615924in"}

**[Subjects]{.underline}**

- **Consumer goods:** The consumer goods industry is a large sector,
  with global reach, that has the ability to influence consumer
  behaviors and supply to the marketplace. While company strategies
  impact sway demand and shape brand perceptions, they may not have the
  power to shift policy narratives and opinions. Their production and
  distribution efforts can be strongly impacted by climate-related risks
  and consequences, meaning they would want to be informed about climate
  challenges, making DestinE a useful tool for preventing disruptions

**[Players]{.underline}**

- **Energy and utility companies:** Can be classified as powerful due to
  their control over essential services and limited options for
  alternatives. This dependence gives these companies influence in
  top-down policy development and over regulations. Energy and utility
  companies would also have high interest in the DestinE Platform as
  climate change and extreme weather events can severely disrupt their
  operations and impact demand for services.

- **Insurance and finance:** DestinE is able to provide insurance
  companies with accurate predictive modelling and real-time data to
  spotlight potential climate related risks that would interfere with
  the capacity to serve households and businesses. Loss of land,
  impacted infrastructure and investments required for climate
  adaptation and mitigation heavily impact household financial security,
  government spending and the financial sector overall. Insurance and
  finance recommendations carry significant weight and influence as a
  result, influencing the ability of policy to drive transformational
  change.

- **Agriculture and food:** Climate-related risks and challenges have
  and will continue to disrupt the agriculture and food sectors,
  interfering with traditional farming practices, eroding soil, damaging
  the health of habitats and perpetuating consequences for the food
  industry overall. The agriculture and food sectors control the food
  marketplace, giving companies significant political influence over the
  policies and regulations that govern our food systems. DestinE can
  serve the agriculture and food sectors with information to build
  resilient food supply chains and production processes.

**[Context Setters]{.underline}**

- **Transportation:** The transportation sector is a strong economic
  force as it connects goods, services and people, making it fundamental
  to advance local, regional and national infrastructure and
  development. As a result, the transportation sector maintains
  significant power in forming policy and regulations. Therefore,
  DestinE Platform services would provide significant value to the
  transportation sector to prevent disruptions in the movement of
  products and people.

- **Construction and real estate:** Climate change and extreme weather
  events can interfere with construction productivity and real estate
  development, making the DestinE Platform an attractive tool for real
  estate developers and construction workers to ensure investment in
  secure environments and the protection of property developments,
  although their attention may not be completely dedicated to resilience
  and mitigation efforts at the moment.

### Customised categorisation

#### DestinE use case makers

DestinE Use case makers consist of organisations and initiatives that
carry and implement a use case of the DestinE initiative, that may be
related to the DestinE Platform, the Data Lake, or a Digital Twin. This
stakeholder category includes several types of stakeholders. Some of
them are presented in Figure 7 and may be analysed as follows:

- **Data providers**: Organisations that contribute data to the DestinE
  Platform, such as satellite imagery, weather data, and demographic
  data. They may be interested in using the platform to showcase their
  data and increase its visibility, as well as to gain insights from
  other data sources. Data providers may be concerned about the accuracy
  and quality of their data in relation to other data sources, as well
  as issues related to data privacy and security.

- **Model developers**: Organisations that develop models and
  simulations to be used in the DestinE Platform. They may be interested
  in using the platform to showcase their models and increase their
  visibility, as well as to collaborate with other model developers and
  data providers. Model developers may be concerned about the accuracy
  and quality of their models in relation to other models and data
  sources, as well as the potential for intellectual property issues.

- **Application developers**: Organisations that develop applications to
  be used with the DestinE Platform, such as visualisation tools and
  decision support systems. They may be interested in using the platform
  to showcase their applications and increase their visibility, as well
  as to collaborate with other application developers and data
  providers. Application developers may be concerned about issues
  related to data privacy and security, as well as the potential for
  competition from other application developers.

- **Infrastructure providers**: Infrastructure providers are
  organisations that provide hardware and software solutions to support
  the DestinE Platform, such as cloud computing services and data
  storage solutions. They may be interested in partnering with the
  DestinE initiative to provide infrastructure services, as well as to
  collaborate with other infrastructure providers and data providers.
  Infrastructure providers may be concerned about issues related to data
  privacy and security, infrastructure endurance, as well as the
  potential for competition from other infrastructure providers.

- **Policy advocates**: Policy advocates are organisations that advocate
  for policies related to the climate crisis and other environmental
  issues. They may be interested in using the data and insights
  generated by the DestinE Platformto inform their advocacy efforts, as
  well as to collaborate with other stakeholders to advance policy
  goals. Policy advocates may be concerned about issues related to data
  accessibility and the potential for the platform to be used to support
  policies that are contrary to their goals.

- **End-users**: End-users are organisations and individuals that use
  the DestinE Platformand its associated applications and tools to gain
  insights and make decisions related to climate crisis and other
  environmental issues. They may be interested in using the platform to
  access accurate and up-to-date information, as well as to collaborate
  with other stakeholders and share their own insights and data.
  End-users may be concerned about issues related to data privacy and
  security, as well as the usability and accessibility of the platform
  and its associated tools.

makers](./D2.2/images/media/image16.png){width="6.267716535433071in"
height="1.1666666666666667in"}

#### Core DestinE Entities

The organisations that form the Core DestinE Entities are key
stakeholders involved in the funding, creation, implementation, and
validation of Destination Earth. This includes the EC DGCNCT who is
funding the project, the entrusted entities ESA, EUMETSAT and ECMWF, as
well as all other organisations or projects that are involved in these
first stages of DestinE.

#### General public

The general public may have a strong interest in the DestinE initiative
as they may be interested in understanding the impacts of the climate
crisis on their communities and the world at large, as well as
identifying opportunities for adaptation and mitigation. They may also
be interested in understanding how they can contribute to the initiative
and its goals. Citizen scientists also can leverage DestinE Platform
capabilities to support their projects and initiatives. General public
including citizen scientists are considered DestinE Platform users and
potential community members.

### Considerations

Upon categorizing stakeholders their engagement levels should be defined
along with their involvement degree in the process. This includes
raising awareness among all stakeholders, involving potential users, and
empowering final users. The willingness of stakeholders to engage at the
proposed levels should be evaluated before initiating a co-design
process. This process can leverage existing stakeholder networks to
identify additional participants through snowball sampling and validate
if the communication strategy aligns with stakeholder realities.
Knowledge exchange methods like forums, workshops, and interviews are
recommended for effectively conducting these steps.

# DestinE Community Building Strategy development methodology

The development of the DestinE Community Building Strategy follows the
basic principles of Strategic Planning as defined by many scholars in an
international context (Miller and H-Jensen, 1997; Bryson and Einsweiler,
1988; Hopkins and Hopkins, 1997; Andersen, 2000 etc.) and applies the
following methodological approach that shown in Figure 8.

<figure>
<img src="./D2.2/images/media/image17.png"
style="width:6.17708in;height:4.64583in"
alt="Εικόνα που περιέχει κείμενο, στιγμιότυπο οθόνης, κύκλος, γραμματοσειρά Περιγραφή που δημιουργήθηκε αυτόματα" />
<figcaption><p>Figure 8: Methodological approach to the development of
the Community Building and Management Strategy</p></figcaption>
</figure>

Specifically, the steps in the development of the Strategic Plan
include:

- Defining the vision and mission of the Community:

The first step in developing the Strategic Plan involves determining the
guiding vision of the Community, which reflects the goals and values it
seeks to achieve. Subsequently, the \"Mission\" of the Community is
formulated, outlining the expected future state in accordance with the
set vision.

- Analyzing and evaluating the current situation:

At this stage, the External Environment (PEST analysis) was explored,
considering characteristics of the political, social and technological
environment that can positively or negatively influence the development
framework of the community. Information regarding the current internal
environment of the community was then documented considering the
characteristics and dynamics of the community that has been built so far
and its further development. Subsequently, the analysis of the above
information about the characteristics of the internal environment of the
community fueled the application of SWOT analysis, aiming at the
comprehensive exploration of the existing internal environment based on
the identification of endogenous developmental characteristics and
capabilities (strengths and weaknesses) compared to external influencing
factors (opportunities and threats), respectively.

- Formulating Strategic Objectives, Priority fields, Actions:

At this stage, Short-Term Objectives (up to end of 2024) that require
immediate achievement were set along with Medium - Term Strategic
Objectives (up to end of 2026) and Long -- Term Strategic Objectives (up
to end of 2030). For each objective, priority axes, actions, and an
implementation timeline were defined.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *The current Community Building and Management Strategy will serve as |
| the main guide to support the effective development of DestinE        |
| Community and its way forward to sustainability. This is a living     |
| document which will be updated as required during the DEUC project.*  |
|                                                                       |
| *It is a dynamic plan encompassing a series of strategic actions      |
| designed to grow the community. This strategic approach ensures       |
| adaptability to contemporary technological, scientific and initiative |
| related advancements, along with meeting the escalating demands of    |
| end users and benefiting entities.*                                   |
+=======================================================================+

## Vision, Mission and Values

**Vision**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  As we embark on the journey towards 2030, DestinE envisions a thriving
  community, uniting passionate individuals and experts in a dynamic
  ecosystem. The DestinE's community vision is to cultivate an
  unparalleled network where the synergy of continuous interactions among
  users, developers, and other stakeholders propels DestinE\'s evolution,
  contributing significantly to the advancement and continuous use of the
  DestinE Platform and the Destination Earth System overall.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Mission**

To advance towards the set Vision, the Strategy's mission unfolds around
four key pillars (Figure 9). The first pillar, \"Unite,\" manifests as
an aspiration to bring together all interested stakeholders and
communities under a shared banner. Diversity and collaboration are
considered, laying the foundation for a robust and inclusive community
that transcends conventional boundaries.

The second pillar, \"Engage,\" embodies the commitment to actively
involve every member in the community. Through vibrant interactions,
meaningful discussions, and collaborative efforts, DestinE community
strives to create an environment where each voice is heard, valued, and
actively contributes. The goal is to not only unite but to ensure that
every united individual becomes an integral part of the community\'s
fabric.

\"Drive Usage and Growth,\" the third pillar, emphasizes the
community\'s determination to increase the usage of DestinE\'s platform
and services. User engagement takes center stage, empowering community
members to actively participate in co-designing the platform and
services evolution. This collaborative approach propels both the
community and its offerings forward, fostering innovation and sustained
growth.

The fourth and final pillar, \"Sustain,\" underscores DestinE\'s
commitment to creating a community that not only thrives but also
sustains and grows itself. Through responsible practices, ethical
decision-making, and a long-term vision, DestinE aims to be a beacon of
sustainability in the digital landscape, ensuring the community\'s
enduring impact.

**Values**

Establishing values within a community is crucial as it helps to define
the community\'s identity and purpose, fosters unity and cooperation,
encourages accountability and responsibility, provides guidance for
decision-making, and enhances its reputation and trustworthiness. Along
these lines, DestinE Users Community aspires to integrate the following
values:

- **Sense of belonging**: The sense of belonging is an important aspect
  of any community, and it provides a number of benefits to its members.
  Members of the DestinE Users Community should experience this sense of
  belonging and feel comfortable to share their thoughts, take an active
  role in the community and contribute to its success. Moreover, the
  members of the community should be able to excploit opportunities for
  social connection and develop meaningful collaborations and
  partnerships with others who share common or complementary interests
  and values. Finally, the sense of belonging can increase motivation to
  participate in community activities and achieve shared goals.

- **Co-design:** The active participation of DestinE Users Community
  members in the development and design of DestinE Platform is
  considered significant. Co-design in the DestinE Users Community aims
  to put users at the centre of the design process, ensuring that their
  needs, preferences, and feedback are collated and communicated
  effectively to the developers that oversee the final services. This
  will lead to more user-friendly, intuitive, and satisfying
  experiences. Being involved in co-design, members of the community
  will be able to experience a sense of ownership and investment in
  DestinE Platform evolution. It will also foster innovation and
  creativity by bringing together diverse perspectives and ideas. This
  can lead to novel solutions and approaches that might not have been
  possible with a more limited, top-down design approach.

- **Openness and transparency:** Openness and transparency are
  considered to be amongst the core values that the Destine Users
  Community aims to embrace. It is crucial to foster open communication
  and build trust among members. Members should be encouraged to share
  information and insights about their experiences, knowledge on a
  topic, and challenges with one another. Open and accessible channels
  for communication should be provided so as members can share their
  thoughts and ideas, ask questions, and get involved in discussions.
  Access to information, such as documentation, product roadmaps, and
  development plans, should be provided. When users provide feedback or
  raise concerns, it\'s important to be responsive and transparent about
  how their feedback is being used. Regularly sharing updates about the
  progress of activities, features, or services should be enforced to
  build trust and demonstrate a commitment to transparency. It is also
  important that members are able to see how decisions are being made
  and how their feedback is being incorporated.

- **Diversity:** The DestinE Users Community aims to be welcoming and
  inclusive to individuals from diverse backgrounds, experiences,
  identities, and gender. To promote diversity and equality within the
  community, a code of conduct will be defined and made easily
  accessible to all members of the community and prohibit any form of
  discrimination and harassment. To encourage diversity and inclusivity
  in the community, members from different backgrounds and perspectives
  will be invited to join by promoting the community through various
  channels and ensuring that outreach efforts are inclusive. It is also
  important to foster an environment of mutual respect and support by
  encouraging members to listen to and learn from each other, as well as
  provide opportunities for members to participate and contribute to the
  community regardless of their diverse backgrounds, geographical or
  other differences. Additionally, the usage of gender inclusive
  language will be strongly promoted both in the discussions and
  activities (physical and virtual) and in the outreach and
  communication material. Moreover, it is significant to integrate
  inclusivity throughout the activities of user requirements and
  feedback collection to ensure that intersectional and diversity
  analyses are being mainstreamed into the design of DestinE Platform
  services.

- **Equity:** All members within the DestinE Users Community should have
  access to the same resources and opportunities for participation and
  engagement regardless of their background, identity, or socio-economic
  status, giving priority to stakeholders from EU Member States.
  Training and skill-building opportunities to members of the community
  who may face barriers to participation should also be considered as
  well as engagement in outreach and recruitment efforts to attract
  members from underrepresented or marginalised groups including
  targeted advertising that reach out to diverse communities.

- **Sustainability:** DestinE Users Community should be sustainable and
  grow and evolve over time throughout DestinE initiative implementation
  and beyond. This requires creating a strong sense of community,
  ownership and fostering relationships between members. It requires
  also to empower community leaders to take ownership of the community
  and to continuously encourage community members to share their
  experiences and ideas through user-generated content. Collaboration
  among community members to foster relationships and create a sense of
  shared purpose should also be encouraged. Ultimately, a common online
  place for communication should be established and tools and guidelines
  for community management and uptake should be provided.

## Analysis and evaluation of the external and internal environment of the community

### **External environment (PEST analysis)**

**Political:**

The political landscape, particularly driven by initiatives like the
European Green Deal, provides a favorable environment for the
development of a digital twin of the Earth. The commitment to climate
neutrality and sustainable economic growth enhances the initiative\'s
relevance and support. The alignment with Digital Strategy priorities
further ensures that political backing facilitates transparency,
accountability, and collaborative efforts between the public and private
sectors, fostering an environment conducive to the initiative\'s
success.

**Economic:**

The economic factors, shaped by recent crises such as the Covid-19
outbreak and geopolitical tensions, present both challenges and
opportunities for the initiative. Economic uncertainties highlight the
importance of the digital twin\'s role in providing a tool for modeling
and simulating natural hazards, aiding in economic resilience. The
initiative\'s success will be influenced by its ability to address
economic concerns related to environmental uncertainties and contribute
to stability through accurate adaptation strategies and mitigation
measures.

**Social:**

The social fabric characterized by diversity and pluralism in Europe
influences the initiative\'s development and adoption. EU policies on
digital transformation and the reduction of social inequalities align
positively with the initiative\'s goals. However, the challenge lies in
managing the abundance of information accessible to EU citizens. The
initiative\'s effectiveness will be influenced by its capacity to bridge
the gap between information abundance and societal needs, particularly
in the context of social dynamics and responses to natural disasters.

**Technological:**

Technological factors play a pivotal role in shaping the initiative\'s
trajectory. Community contribution through voluntary data sharing is
crucial for enhancing data quality, accuracy, and interoperability.
While advanced technologies like AI offer opportunities, the initiative
must navigate associated risks in cybersecurity and data protection.
Compliance with EU legal frameworks ensures responsible technological
integration. The initiative\'s success is contingent on its ability to
adapt and leverage evolving technologies within the defined regulatory
landscape, ensuring a secure and technologically robust digital twin.

## Short-Term Objectives -- 2024 

Embarking on the journey to establish a thriving DestinE Platform by
2030, our strategic approach involves meticulous planning and the early
cultivation of a vibrant community. Recognising the significance of
community engagement in shaping the success of the platform and the
initiative in general, we aim to lay the groundwork well before the
initial launch -- foreseen for 2024. To achieve this, a set of
short-term objectives are outlined that focus on community-building
initiatives and community members engagement to create a robust
foundation for DestinE Platform's launch but also laying the groundwork
for a sustained, interactive, and supportive community that will propel
our success well into the future.

**STO1 - Community Members base expansion to 3K by the end of 2024**

Presently, the community stands at a membership of 1,300+ registered
individuals, symbolizing a community united by a shared commitment to
fully exploit and advance DestinE Platform and DestinE.

As we conclude the year 2024, we aspire to achieve significant growth,
targeting 3,000 registered members within the DestinE community,
assuming that there will be means to centralise data collection between
the DestinE website (where the community is gathered) and the DestinE
Platform (which would most likely be the first entry point for
registering DestinE users). This numerical ambition is an estimation of
our commitment to fostering a diverse and engaged community dedicated to
advancing the DestinE Platform. The target of 3k registered users refers
to the overall community i.e. both to those registered to the website
being interested in being informed for DestinE evolution and to those
registered to the DestinE Platform.

To achieve this strategic objective the following Priority Axes and
actions are set.

**Priority Axis -- PA1.1: DEUC Communities of Practice enabled**

Communities of Practice (CoPs) CoPs are groups of people who share a
common interest, concern, or passion and come together to learn from
each other, solve problems and address challenges. CoPs can provide a
place for individuals to:

- Share their knowledge, experience, and expertise with each other.

- Innovate and generate new ideas.

- Co-design, validate and promote products and strategies.

- Discuss and address common challenges together.

- Network and build relationships with others in their field, which can
  lead to new opportunities and collaborations.

In the context of the DEUC project, CoPs will be used to:

- Identify DestinE Platform user needs and preferences. By engaging with
  users through a CoP, it will be possible to get feedback on what
  features or functions are most important to them.

- Tap into the knowledge and expertise of individuals from different
  fields or industries. This can help the development of DestinE
  Platform that will meet the needs of a wide range of users.

- Test and validate the developed features and functionalities with the
  end users -- which according to the feedback solicited can be refined
  to meet the user needs.

- Foster collaboration between individuals with different backgrounds
  and perspectives. This can lead to new ideas and approaches to DestinE
  Platform development.

- Support adoption and uptake of DestinE Platform.

This way, the needs and recommendations of different user groups will be
better understood ensuring that the development of DestinE Platformis
guided by the specific needs of the users, leading to more effective and
impactful solutions. Moreover, the creation of CoPs will help to promote
the wide adoption of DestinE Platform, as members of the CoPs become
ambassadors for the platform within their respective communities.

In addition, CoPs can be exploited in the context of the work and
projects carried out by the three Entrusted Entities (3Es): ESA, ECMWF
and EUMETSAT in terms of joint participation in events, usage of CoPs
activities to generate insights for 3Es' work, organisation of joint
events where all communities can work together etc.

**CoPs -- Organic creation approach**

Recognising the existence of various communities already in fields
related to DestinE initiative, our approach is to harness their
potential and build upon their foundations.

By tapping into established networks, expertise, and shared interests,
we harness the collective potential of these communities to drive the
formation of specialized CoPs. This organic formation of vibrant and
self-sustaining CoPs ensures relevance, engagement, and collaboration
while capitalising on the knowledge and relationships already present.
By adopting this strategy, DestinE will create a strong foundation for
the development of CoPs, enabling knowledge sharing, collaboration, and
innovation to flourish.

Established communities often comprise individuals with significant
expertise and experience in specific areas. By integrating these
communities, we gain access to their collective knowledge, which can
serve as a strong foundation for the formation of specialised CoPs. This
approach ensures that CoPs are established with a solid knowledge base
and have access to subject matter experts who can guide and mentor
community members.

Moreover, leveraging existing communities helps ensure that CoPs are
aligned with the interests and needs of participants. By involving
community members in the formation process, we can leverage their input
and feedback to shape the focus and direction of CoPs. This
participatory approach increases the relevance of CoPs and encourages
active engagement and contribution from community members.

In addition, the Use Cases to be procured within the DEUC project can
lead to the creation of new CoPs covering various thematic perspectives
related to the Green Deal and Digital Transformation.

Taking into consideration the two Digital Twins that are being
developed, each CoP, will be discussing and holding activities that
involve discussions regarding their themes in relation to Weather
Extremes and Climate Change Adaptation. Within these, there will be a
validation of existing DestinE Platform capabilities, as well as
discussions on the design of future DestinE Platform capabilities
(**Figure 10**).

**Figure 10: Areas that CoPs activities may focus**

**CoPs set-up, operation and governance**

As DestinE is an ongoing endeavour, CoPs need to be inaugurated and
commence their interactions before they develop and flourish into
thriving hubs, centred around member interactions, offering
opportunities for co-development.

Activities in 2024 focus on establishing the first set of CoPs. These
may evolve from existing communities or emerge as new groups. Key
activities\
during this phase include:

- **Onboarding Initial Members**: Recruiting participants who are
  passionate about contributing to the DestinE project through the
  DestinE Platform.

- **Developing a Collaborative Framework**: This framework will foster
  co-design with end users, emphasizing the importance of listening,
  empathy, and understanding diverse perspectives and needs.

- **Building a Foundation for Future Growth**: By slowly expanding the
  member base and activities, these CoPs will gradually contribute
  insights and recommendations to the DestinE project through DestinE
  Platform.

The operation of CoPs shall be supported by a governance model which has
to be flexible and adaptable to the community\'s changing needs and
circumstances as well as transparent and inclusive, ensuring that all
members have a say in the community\'s activities. In the context of
DEUC project each CoP may be led by a Community Facilitator, who will be
responsible for facilitating communication and collaboration within the
group. In case of existing communities, the Community Facilitator from
DEUC project side will be responsible for facilitating communication and
collaboration regarding DestinE Platform activities in accordance with
the rules of each existing community and in consultation with the leader
of that community.

Members of the CoPs can be passive or active. A passive member can
follow updates about DestinE activities and outputs. An active member
can participate in the activities (co-design, user recommendations
collection, hackathons, etc.), use and test DestinE services, propose
topics of interest, share content and relevant work, as well as have
access to a range of resources and tools, including webinars, online
discussion forums, and training materials.

At the current stage of the DEUC project, anyone who is interested in
applying for becoming a member of DestinE community can apply online via
a dedicated form in the website
([[https://destination-earth.eu/destine-community/become-part-of-the-destine-community/]{.underline}](https://destination-earth.eu/destine-community/become-part-of-the-destine-community/)).

CoPs are designed to function both physically and online. Physical
operation of CoPs will take place via the organisation or participation
in physical events. Online operation during 2024 will take place via
online meetings (see PA1.3).

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Update July 2025**

In the context of Priority Axis PA1.1, efforts were undertaken in 2024
and 2025 to establish two Communities of Practice (CoPs), specifically
focusing on Education.

The Education CoP was successfully established, and two initial
engagement events were conducted. These events demonstrated positive
early interactions, fostering discussions and exchanges among
participants, and laying a foundational structure for continued
collaboration. However, the continuity and further development of this
CoP, along with the establishment of the second CoP focusing on Climate
Modelling, encountered significant challenges. These challenges were
primarily due to the limited maturity of the DestinE Platform, which
hindered the ability to effectively sustain ongoing activities and
interactions within these communities.

As a result, the further expansion and consistent operation of the
Education CoP, as well as the formal initiation of the Climate Modelling
CoP, have been temporarily postponed. Addressing the technical and
functional maturity of the DestinE Platform remains a key prerequisite
for resuming and fully realizing the potential of these CoPs.

Looking forward, and in alignment with the \"D2.3 Roadmap for a wider
DestinE system uptake,\" it is clear that the user community requires
tailored actions for each target group. These actions must be informed
by expected usage patterns, specific user needs, and sectoral relevance.
Therefore, the establishment and continued development of CoPs remain
highly meaningful. Efforts should be made in the coming years to ensure
platform maturity, enabling these communities to effectively use DestinE
resources and significantly enhance user engagement and uptake.

**Priority Axis -- PA1.2: Community engagement via organization of
events and activities**

To enhance community engagement and foster growth, PA1.2 focus on
organizing events and activities to create a vibrant and interactive
environment. The aims is to host regular events tailored to the
interests and needs of the community members to significantly boost
participation and cultivate a sense of belonging. These events could
range from webinars, workshops, to virtual social gatherings or
collaborative projects. Additionally, incorporating interactive elements
within events, such as Q&A sessions, polls, and networking
opportunities, will ensure that community members actively contribute
and feel valued. Leveraging various communication channels, including
social media, newsletters, and dedicated event platforms, will amplify
the reach and accessibility of the community events. Encouraging
user-generated content or facilitating member-led sessions will also
further empower the community. Ultimately, a well-curated calendar of
events will be developed to enhance community engagement by providing
meaningful and enjoyable experiences, creating a dynamic ecosystem that
attracts new members and retains existing ones.

Update July 2024:

Activity 1 and 2 and activity A have been successfully implemented.

The originally planned activity schedule was impacted by a delay in the
platform release. While the platform is now available, user registration
is not yet functional. Due to this, implementation of community
activities has been further delayed. This delay is twofold:

- Limited member experience: Community members expressed a desire to be
  able to see and interact with the platform functionalities before
  engaging in activities.

- Content creation dependence: Our team requires a fully operational
  platform to create and manage content for the planned events.

Update July 2025:

While the activities planned for 2024 had some success, particularly the
initial events of the Education CoP, the planned Hackathon (Activity B)
could not be implemented as intended. The Hackathon, designed to
leverage DEUC project use cases, was contingent on these use cases\'
timely availability. Unfortunately, delays in the release of these use
cases prevented the Hackathon from proceeding as planned.

Moving forward, it will be crucial to synchronize the Hackathon and
similar engagement events closely with the availability and maturity of
the platform and relevant content.

**Priority Axis -- PA1.3: Dissemination and communication**

The priority axis of \"Dissemination and Communication\" is pivotal in
achieving the ambitious goal of reaching 3,000 members within one year.
This focus underscores the significance of effectively conveying the
community\'s mission, values, and offerings to a broader audience.
Through targeted dissemination, the community can extend its reach,
attracting individuals who align with its vision and creating awareness
among potential stakeholders. Communication plays a key role in
articulating the unique value proposition of the community, emphasizing
the benefits of membership, and showcasing the vibrant ecosystem it
offers.

An effective dissemination and communication strategy has been put in
place already which involves leveraging diverse channels to engage with
potential members. Regular and compelling content creation, such as blog
posts, articles, and infographics showcase the community and foster
interest. Establishing partnerships, both online and offline, can also
amplify the dissemination efforts, tapping into existing networks and
increasing visibility. Ultimately, by strategically disseminating
information and maintaining clear and consistent communication, the
community can catalyze interest, draw in new members, and achieve the
targeted goal of 3,000 members within the stipulated timeframe.

A Communication and Engagement plan has been put in place since 2023 and
is detailed in Chapter 4 of the current document.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

All activities outlined in PA1.3 have been completed and are now part of
regular operations. The Communication and Engagement Plan gets updated
whenever priorities shift. Community news, event updates, and outreach
materials are shared across different platforms on a regular basis.
Participation in both online and face-to-face events has increased
visibility and expanded reach within the community. Performance
monitoring continues to track communication effectiveness, ensuring
messaging hits the mark and supports goals for community growth and
engagement.

**STO2 - Enforce user interaction with** DestinE Platform **platform --
reach 1K registrations by the end of 2024**

The year 2024 will witness the pivotal launch of the DestinE Platform.
This event is a seminal moment, as our community transitions into a
digital realm, providing a curated space for collaboration, connection,
and the amalgamation of knowledge. By mid-2024, it is expected that user
registration on the DestinE Platform will be enabled. This step
represents an intentional effort to broaden our community\'s reach,
inviting individuals to use and interact with the platform. The goal is
set to reach 1K registrations to DestinE Platform platform by the end of
2024. It is not only about the platform\'s introduction but onboarding
community members as DestinE Platform registered users.

To achieve this strategic objective the following Priority Axes and
actions are set.

**Priority Axis -- PA2.1: Community members become** DestinE Platform
**registered users**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Actions**                                          **Timetable**
  ------------------------------------------------ ----------------------
  A2.1.1 Develop a structured onboarding material           2024
  to guide community members through the process   
  of becoming DestinE Platform registered users.   

  A2.1.2 Provide step-by-step tutorials,                    2024
  documentation, and support to ensure a seamless  
  transition onto the platform.                    

  A2.1.3 Foster MOOCs uptake to familiarize                 2024
  members and users with DestinE Platform features 
  and functionalities (linked to PA2.2).           
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  ensure learners feel supported and connected to  
  the learning process.                            
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Update July 2025:

The implementation of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) of the DestinE
initiative could introduce to thousands of citizens around the world the
DestinE project, its capabilities, its real data-based use cases, and
simultaneously inspire and motivate users to create something of their
own or present their already implemented work via the DestinE Platform.
It has been proven worldwide that MOOCs, with their diverse content,
including videos, quizzes, presentations, forums, and many more
features, have helped users of other platforms and initiatives to
understand, communicate, collaborate, and evolve both personally and
collectively.

This DestinE MOOC is structured in a way to cover all the basic features
and points of the project, but also be open for updates and new entries
as the project evolves throughout the years and with different
contractors. In addition, this MOOC targets DestinE users who would like
to deepen their understanding of DestinE\'s abilities and features and
utilize them to grow through them. At the same time, this MOOC is open
and accessible to people who are uninformed of the project, allowing
them to learn about DestinE's initiative, services, and Use Cases, and
benefit from them.

The development of the DestinE MOOC is structured into two
modules/sections, representing the implementation of the Actions A2.2.1
and A2.2.2 of the PA2.2 plan. At the first module of the MOOC, named
"DestinE explained: An introduction to the DestinE initiative and its
mission", the students will be able to know more about the DestinE
initiative, its mission, its components, and the Entrusted Entities
leading this project. At the same time, the students will understand the
advantages, values, and objectives of DestinE, as well as its community,
its services, and DestinE Digital Twins. . All these are explained via
practical examples of using DestinE Platform, . This MOOC is further
enriched in its second module/section, which hosts the description of
the five Use Cases - Services implemented for ESA by several providers.
Its provider prepared content, based on a prearranged common structure,
to introduce their Use Case, explain its features, and showcase its
integration to the DestinE Platform as a service. The purpose and key
outcomes of each use case are presented to showcase the importance of
their integration into the DestinE Platform. In addition, the data,
methodologies, and tools used per Use Case are analyzed, following an
analytical tutorial on how to use the developed DestinE services. The
topics of these Use Cases include urban heat, urban planning, energy,
flooding, fishery management, risk management, and polar voyage
planning.

**STO3 - Develop and set a co-design framework within the community**

The approach of co-design keeps the individuals involved in any way in
DestinE, close to its centre. These individuals, irrespective of their
technical skills, bring to the table their personal expertise in their
line of work, which is crucial for the holistic development and approach
for DestinE. From policy makers and first responders in climate change
events who may share views on what kind of information is most important
to view in case of emergencies and in what format, to research and
academia personnel who can share how they may use the available data to
conduct their research, and to developers of new products and services
who wish to explore how to elevate available datasets into useful
proposals and use cases, co-design is an approach that requires
openness, acceptance of various views, transparency and a democratic
mindset.

Though codesign can involve various depths of involvement of users in
the design process, from simply inviting the sharing views, to citizen
science and user generated decision making, the aforementioned users and
stakeholders involved in various ways, by sharing views and
recommendations with DestinE Platform developers, in regard to their
needs and day-today problems. Following, DestinE Platform developers can
prioritize and address whether these recommendations can become parts,
capabilities, or features of the core DestinE Platform service, as it is
being developed. However, it must be clear that the final decision
making on which recommendation is implemented and to what extent,
currently remains with the DestinE Platform developers, since they
maintain a bird's eye view of the entire development process.

Users and stakeholders share their input in this co-design process
through organized and curated activities and tools, such as "User
Stories", sharing how they operate today and how they might operate in
the future with the presence of DesitnE, "User Journey Maps", sharing
their activities and detailed steps of how they operate day to day,
"Card Sorting", sharing their preferences among preselected choices on
specifically asked questions, taking part in to Q&As in Community of
Practice (CoP) discussion sessions, responding to questionnaires as part
of the CoP activities and casually exchanging views and viewpoints
during the community's networking activities.

Additionally, given the activity of existing communities of the 3Es, the
DestinE community aims to reach out, involve and liase with these
communities in its planned activities, as the project goal is universal
and mutually beneficial. Within these activities, DestinE Platform
developers are involved directly or indirectly in the interactions
between community members and once each is completed, developers will be
informed of the output and key interaction points through community
feedback loops in post-event actions.

The identification of users and their engagement may follow the
successful example of "climate services coproduction processes"[^2]
i.e.:

a\. Step 1: Establish the Why - High-Level Goal Conceptualization: To
begin by focusing on the overarching goal or issue before diving into
specifics. To consider high-level goals that may involve policy changes,
attitude shifts, new collaborations, or empowerment.

b\. Step 2: Identify the Where - Defining the Case: To define the
specific context, recognizing the complexity of interconnected systems
and various levels of influence.

c\. Step 3: Determine Whom to Include - Stakeholder and User
Identification: To identify stakeholders and users based on their
relevance to the high-level goal. Consider participatory methodologies
to dispel initial assumptions and ensure mutual learning.

d\. Step 4: Select Which Attributes - From Stakeholders to Users: Το
characterize stakeholders based on attributes like influence, power, and
legitimacy. Determine their role in the coproduction process based on
factors such as urgency, legitimacy, and knowledge types.

e\. Step 5: Define Engagement Intensity: To determine the degree of
involvement in the coproduction process based on attributes identified
in Step 4. Tailor engagement intensity from awareness raising for all
stakeholders to involvement for potential users and empowerment for
final users.

**Priority Axis -- PA3.1: Establish a co-design approach in community
activities**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Actions**                                          **Timetable**
  ------------------------------------------------ ----------------------
  A3.1.1 Develop clear and concise guidelines that          2024
  outline the principles and processes of          
  co-design within the community.                  

  A3.1.2 Identify specific activities, features,            2024
  or initiatives within the community that are     
  suitable for co-design (linked with PA1.2)       

  A3.1.3 Establish a process for recognizing and            2024
  showcasing members\' contributions to co-design  
  activities.                                      
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Priority Axis -- PA3.2: Effectively communicate the community
co-design results to** DestinE Platform **developers**

The establishment of a robust communication channel, where community
recommendations are conveyed to DestinE Platform developers, directly
influencing the trajectory of feature development is crucial for the
community to fulfil its existence and role while ensuring that the
platform is finely tuned to the evolving needs and aspirations of its
user base.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Actions**                                          **Timetable**
  ------------------------------------------------ ----------------------
  A3.2.1 Establish a User-Feedback                          2024
  Approach/Protocol.                               

  A3.2.2 Provide an online place for users to               2024
  share recommendations, insights, and experiences 
  which will be shared with the DestinE Platform   
  development team.                                

  A3.2.3 Provide regular updates on how user                2024
  feedback is being processed, implemented, and    
  contributing to platform enhancements.           
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Update 2025:

While the specific actions listed under PA3.1 and PA3.2 have not been
formally implemented (the online forum is under development), community
activities held throughout 2023 & 2024 served as vital sources of
continuous user feedback. This feedback has been regularly collected and
directly informed the recommendations presented in \"D2.3 Roadmap for a
wider DestinE system uptake.\" These user insights have been
consistently communicated to the DestinE Platform development team
through ongoing feedback loops.

As also highlighted in D2.3, co-design is a key area of interest and
expectation for the DestinE user community. While foundational steps
have been taken through community engagement, more concrete and
structured objectives and actions are necessary to meet these
expectations. These next steps are now more clearly articulated in D2.3
and are expected to guide future implementation efforts toward a
formalized co-design framework within the community.
