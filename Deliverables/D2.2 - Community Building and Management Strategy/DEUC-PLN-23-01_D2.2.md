The DestinE Community Management Strategy and Workplan (CBMS) is the document that outlines expectations and procedures for implementing an open stakeholder dialogue within the ESA DestinE Use Cases project (DEUC), in accordance with the DestinE Partnership Plan. 

This current version (V6.0) is the 5th official iteration of the D2.2 Community Building and Management Strategy crystallising the living document updates following feedback received as well as updates based on experience in implementing the strategy and plan. 

In Section 2, targeted stakeholders are mapped and categorised. 

Section 3, consists of the DestinE Community Building Strategy which outlines the approach to effectively build, engage and manage the DestinE User Community while nurturing the ground for the successful exploitation of DestinE Platoform capabilities, applications, and solutions by the users.

DestinE is an initiative of the European Commission to **develop a highly-accurate digital twin of Earth** to model, monitor, and simulate natural and human activity Earth System phenomena and natural hazards to develop and test scenarios that will assist policy-makers in designing accurate and actionable adaptation strategies and mitigation measures for achieving both the [Green Deal](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en) and the [Digital Strategy](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strategy_en) priorities of the EU:

- **DestinE will anticipate both natural disasters and man-made environmental damage** with ever higher accuracy. It will identify and assess the negative impacts of natural disasters and environmental damage on various socio-economic sectors and geographical regions. In other words, DestinE will integrate ‘cause and effect’ – combining better forecasts of potential environmental disasters with their expected adverse impacts on human activity.
- **DestinE will enable the continuous and accurate monitoring of the health of the planet** by focusing on the countless effects of climate change on, e.g., the oceans, water resources, the Earth’s ice caps, biodiversity, land use, and other natural resources.
- **DestinE will allow to better understand the socio-economic effects of climate change and the occurrence of extreme natural disasters**. For example, between 1980 and 2017, floods, droughts, heat waves and other climate-related extremes caused economic losses in excess of €420 billion and have claimed the lives of more than 115,000 people across Europe.
- **DestinE will help adapting to climate change related challenges** by providing a common **infrastructure for the users at various levels** for supporting informed and actionable decision-making for policy measures, for example, to assess the real impact and efficiency of environmental policies and related legislative measures.

In the Commission’s Data Strategy of 2020, DestinE is highlighted as an initiative that will cover concrete actions in the context of the Green Deal Data Space and in support of the Green Deal objectives. 

DestinE will be implemented gradually over the next 7-10 years. The activities funded by the [DIGITAL Work Progamme 2021-2022](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/work-programmes-digital) will focus on the deployment of the Core Service Platform and the Data Lake, the building of the Digital Twin Engine and the implementation of the first two Digital Twins on Weather-induced & Geophysical Extremes and on Climate Change Adaptation that will be integrated into the platform. In later stages, these initial components will be complemented by additional digital twins, tools and applications by research institutions, private sector and civil society. Additional funding will be available from other sources, e.g., the Horizon Europe Programme.

DestinE will also have a clear interface with the European Union’s flagship Space programme Copernicus and its relevant resources. 
1. ## <a name="_l7pclgfmjamr"></a><a name="_toc139297760"></a><a name="_toc152171280"></a><a name="_toc155973204"></a><a name="_toc203407376"></a>Stakeholder Mapping
The DestinE stakeholders will contribute to the design and development of the system through a co-design process to ensure that the system responds to real user needs and provides novelty in comparison to their current operational environments.

Considering the size and goals of the DestinE initiative, the user community shall be composed of multiple and diverse types of stakeholders.

Based on the insights from Baulenas, et. Al, (2023), the significance of stakeholder engagement extends beyond mere categorization, emphasizing the depth of interaction. Stakeholders should be differentiated by their engagement levels, including terms like "superusers," "companion-partner users," "fellow users," "champion users," and "next users". The role also of influential stakeholders, such as highly regarded scientists or policy intermediaries, is pivotal. These individuals or entities, can sponsor projects, serving as connectors within social networks and inspiring broader participation. Furthermore, engaging intermediary organizations like community-based groups can ensure the engagement process remains equitable and transparent, preventing the marginalization of certain communities. Thus, the categorization of the stakeholders should take into account:

- The stakeholder's contribution to the service's success.
- The stakeholder's interest in the service.
- The resources (e.g., finances, expertise, local knowledge) the stakeholder offers.
- The impact of some stakeholders on the engagement of others.
- Barriers to meaningful engagement.
- The service's capacity to manage increasing disaster severity.
- The inclusivity of diverse perspectives and stakeholder groups.
- Representation of diverse demographics and marginalized groups.
- The stakeholder's network access that could enhance service uptake.

<a name="_9h1a0e9q8o83"></a>For the current stage of DestinE and before the system launch, the classification of the stakeholders for the stakeholders’ mapping will be based on three different levels, the spatial, their expertise, and the customised one. Upon system release, the stakeholders/users will be further categorized by their usage levels as follows:

- Leaders (DG-CNECT)
- Co - developers (ESA-ECMWF-EUMETSAT)
- Creators (EE's contractors & partners)
- Consumers (policy/decision makers)
- All other DestinE Users

The spatial categorisation will be used for policy and decision makers, while the expertise will apply to the research and academia, technology providers, and industry. For these two categories, a Power-Interest matrix will better define the recommended targeting and value propositions.

This classification enables focused engagement tactics by matching the influence and interest of each stakeholder group in DestinE. Because their activity mostly relies on access to DestinE's data, subjects are mapped as high-interest but low-power stakeholders because they lack the institutional clout to direct the project. Because of their dual roles as important contributors and beneficiaries, players are positioned at the centre of the effort, playing a crucial role in both influencing and benefiting from DestinE. Context Setters are very powerful in their domains, but because of their lack of alignment with DestinE's current focus, engaging them requires special efforts. Lastly, the Crowd's marginal significance to DestinE defines it, so engagement tactics focus on increasing awareness and offering easy-to-use tools to encourage involvement.

The DestinE Use case makers, the Core DestinE Entities, and the general public have a special classification of their own, as they apply to different categorisations and peculiarities. A visual representation of the above stakeholders’ categories is seen in Figure 1.

<a name="_6vh4kaiql63s"></a>**Figure **1** Stakeholder categorisation**


1. ### **Categorisation based on a spatial scale**
Using a spatial approach to generate a stakeholders' map is important for several reasons. First, different stakeholders may have different levels of interest and influence depending on the spatial scale. For example, local stakeholders such as community groups and NGOs may be more influential at the local and regional scales, while national governments and international organisations may have more influence at the national and global scales. By considering stakeholders at different spatial scales, the DestinE initiative can ensure that it is engaging with the right stakeholders at the right levels of decision-making. Second, DestinE aims to provide insights and solutions that are applicable at different spatial scales. For example, the project may provide local decision-makers with information and tools to improve disaster risk management and adaptation, while also providing global decision-makers with information on the impacts of the climate crisis on a global scale. By considering stakeholders at different spatial scales, the project can ensure that the insights and solutions it provides are relevant and applicable to different decision-makers and contexts. Moreover, considering stakeholders at different spatial scales can help to identify potential conflicts and trade-offs between different stakeholders and scales. By considering stakeholders at different spatial scales, DestinE can identify potential conflicts and work to develop solutions that are beneficial at multiple scales. Last but not least, engaging stakeholders at an ecoregion level is expected to be vital, considering that areas that are identified as similar require a similar course of action.
1. #### <a name="_gs8z01t3swwa"></a>*Policymakers*
Policymakers, including representatives from government agencies and international organisations, may be interested in using the data and insights to inform policy development and implementation. They may have a strong interest in understanding the impacts of the climate crisis and extreme weather events, and how they can be mitigated and adapted to. Policymakers are key stakeholders and main beneficiaries of the DestinE initiative, as it provides them with a powerful and unique tool for analysis and prediction, to make data-driven policy decisions. As the EU works toward its goal of being carbon neutral by 2050, DestinE initiative will serve as the foundation for successful European adaptation strategies in support of the European Commission’s.

Policymakers are considered key users of the DestinE Platform. Thus, policymakers' needs identification is critical. Their specific classification is shown in Figure 2 and may occur as follows:

- **Local policymakers**: city councils, local governments responsible for managing natural resources, local environmental agencies i.e., environmental protection departments.
- **Regional policymakers**: regional authorities responsible for managing natural resources i.e., regional councils for the environment and sustainable development.
- **National policymakers**: national ministries of environment, national meteorological and hydrological services, members of parliament, officials from relevant national departments, and civil protection services, emergency services.
- **Continental scale policymakers**: European Emergency Coordination Center, European Commission's Directorate-General for climate action, the European Environment Agency, members of the European Parliament, representatives of the European Commission and other EU bodies, officials from intergovernmental organisations operating at the continental level, representatives of national governments and authorities.
- **Ecoregions policymakers**: representatives of organisations working at the level of the 14 major ecoregions.
- **Global scale policymakers**: representatives of the United Nations and its agencies, officials from intergovernmental organisations working at the global level, and representatives of international NGOs working on global issues.

<a name="_ug042vdd2e1k"></a>**Figure **2** Policymakers breakdown**

![](006.png)

**Subjects**

- **Local:** Local policymakers, including city councils, local governments, and environmental agencies, hold limited power within their jurisdiction but demonstrate high interest in DestinE. For these actors, the platform offers practical tools to manage natural resources, address environmental challenges, and plan sustainable urban development. For instance, DestinE data can inform strategies for local climate resilience or disaster preparedness.
- **Regional:** Regional authorities have moderate influence within their territories and display strong interest in DestinE's capabilities. Regional councils for the environment and sustainable development can use DestinE to harmonise resource management across municipalities, fostering collaboration and improving ecological outcomes. DestinE offers an integrative approach to regional challenges such as water resource management or biodiversity protection.
- **Ecoregional:** At the ecoregion level, policymakers represent organisations focused on specific biogeographical areas. With significant interest but limited power, these actors can leverage DestinE to align their conservation policies with data-driven insights and better articulate the needs of their unique ecological systems to larger-scale stakeholders.

**Players**

- **National:** National policymakers, including ministries, parliament members, and emergency services, are central players due to their significant power and high interest in DestinE. The platform offers unparalleled data for crafting national climate adaptation policies, disaster risk management strategies, and environmental regulations. Additionally, DestinE enables more informed decision-making for hydrological services and civil protection agencies, enhancing national resilience to climate impacts.
- **Continental:** Policymakers at this level, such as the European Commission's Directorate-General for Climate Action and the European Environment Agency, wield considerable power and exhibit strong interest in DestinE. As stewards of EU-wide climate policies and programmes, they can use DestinE to harmonise climate action across member states, monitor compliance, and support policy design informed by cutting-edge simulations and data integration. DestinE's validation through use cases also builds trust among these actors, further cementing its role as a cornerstone of EU climate initiatives.

**Context Setters**

- **Global:** Global policymakers, such as representatives of UN agencies and international NGOs, hold substantial influence but have a broader focus, placing them in the Context Setter quadrant as their engagement with DestinE is often indirect. However, as DestinE proves its value in regional and national contexts, it has the potential to shape global climate policy discussions and inform frameworks for international cooperation. Ensuring that these stakeholders understand the platform's potential will be crucial for DestinE's adoption on a global scale.

1. #### *Decision makers*
Decision makers, including high-level government officials and business leaders, may have a strong interest in DestinE as it has the potential to inform and guide policy decisions related to the twin, green and digital transition. They may also be interested in the potential economic benefits of the DestinE Platform, such as increased efficiency and productivity, and job creation. Decision makers are also considered key users of the DestinE Platformand their needs identification is important.

Decision makers are likely to be key supporters of the DestinE initiative, setting them as an early engagement stakeholder. Their specific classification is shown in Figure 3 and may occur as follows:

- Local scale decision makers: city planners, business owners and managers, and community leaders, such as non-profit organisation leaders
- Regional scale decision makers: regional managers, chamber of commerce members, and representatives of non-governmental organisations
- National level decision makers: corporate executives, investment bankers, venture capitalists, and business leaders (e.g., CEOs, CTOs)
- Continental level decision makers: European business leaders, investors, representatives of intergovernmental organisations and representatives of regional development banks.
- Ecoregion decision makers: experts and practitioners with knowledge of specific ecoregions and their particular challenges and representatives of indigenous and other local communities.
- Global scale decision makers: global business CEOs and other executives of major global corporations, and representatives of international organisations focused on climate and the environment.

**Subjects**

Both of the following may have power at the local level, but their limited sphere of influence excludes them from being considered “players” for the context of this analysis.

- **Local:** The different types of subjects at a local level have different levels of local power and different needs, but all of them with an elevated interest in the opportunities offered by DestinE; city planners will undoubtedly be interested in the simulation and planning capabilities of the system that will help them design more resilient and efficient spaces, community leaders can rally and focus on issues that are backed by the data in DestinE, and business owners can narrow and better protect their investments and activities.
- **Ecoregion:** This level includes both experts and practitioners of specific ecoregion systems as well as representatives of indigenous groups and other similar communities. For the first category, DestinE represents a major step forward in advancing their expertise as well as providing them with a platform to resonate with scientists and researchers. For the second, DestinE can be a tool to enhance their advocacy as well as to easily disseminate their collective knowledge on the subjects.

**Players**

- **Continental:** At an international level, business leaders and investors have more to gain from the functionalities of DestinE and can benefit from its data to guide their investments in cross-national developments. This is even more true for representatives of intergovernmental organisations and regional development banks, whose work is directly connected to strengthening the growth and resilience of their competence areas regardless of national borders. DestinE will provide them with a uniquely valuable resource thanks to its core focus on international data and collaboration.
- **Global:** For representatives of large international organisations focused on climate/environment the appeal of DestinE is immediate and deep; the challenge is moreso ensuring that they are aware of it and the functionalities it affords them. In this way, DestinE will play a significant role in international climate-and-weather-related efforts throughout the world. As for executives and representatives of international corporations, though their work does not necessarily focus on the environment, the wealth of present and simulated information that DestinE brings to the table can make it a key decision-making tool for global investments, as well as guiding development & infrastructure strategies.

**Context Setters**

- **Regional:** A category that might even be justifiably inserted in the Crowd quadrant, though kept in this one due to fluctuating levels of power depending on the specific context. Regional managers, chamber of commerce members, and NGO representatives will likely have low levels of interest for DestinE functionalities due to their limited role in environment/climate decision-making processes and the relatively low levels of relevance of these topics to their activities.
- **National:** The National level finds itself firmly in the Context Setter quadrant due to its inversely proportional levels of interest to power. Business leaders, corporate executives and venture capitalists shape the economy of their countries, yet their focus on inward development and dissociation from environmental and climate issues means that few of them will be interested in the opportunities that DestinE offers.

1. ### <a name="_dy75qwm7kcrs"></a>**Categorisation based on the area of expertise**
   1. #### <a name="_6fehp1lodlsa"></a>*Research and academia*
Researchers and academics may be interested in using the data and tools provided by DestinE Platformto advance scientific knowledge and understanding of the earth. They may be interested in using DestinE Platformto exchange knowledge, conduct research, validate models, and test hypotheses. Research and academia are a key stakeholders and beneficiaries of the DestinE platform, as access to the data used and produced as part of the Digital Twins will provide researchers with the tools to comprehend the intricate roles that the environment and people will play in determining the earth’s future, and open up a range of new research questions.

Research and academia stakeholders can have different subcategories on different spatial levels, depending on the focus of their research and their geographical scope. However, in the case of the DestinE initiative, the nature of the research and the digital twin approach make it less relevant to differentiate between research and academia stakeholders based on their spatial location. The research and academia stakeholders involved in DestinE are likely to have expertise in specific fields, such as climate science, hydrology, geology, and atmospheric science, rather than being defined by their spatial location. The same hydrologist, for example, may conduct research at a local, regional, or global scale depending on their research focus and the availability of data. Therefore, in the context of the DestinE Platform, it may be more relevant to classify research and academia stakeholders based on their areas of expertise rather than their spatial location. Based on that, the research and academia classification may include a vast variety of subcategories such as:
![ref2]![ref3]

- Climate scientists
- Meteorologists
- Ecologists
- Hydrologists
- Environmental economists
- Social scientists
- Data scientists
- Environmental scientists
- Computer scientists
- Engineers
- Agronomists
- Biologists


![Diagram

Description automatically generated](011.png) **Figure **4** Indicative research and academia subcategories**

Figure 4 shows indicative subcategories of research and academia. For each of these subcategories, the specific stakeholders involved may vary depending on the spatial level in question. For example, at a local level, climate scientists may include professors at a nearby university, meteorologists may include forecasters at a local station, and ecologists may include researchers at a nearby nature preserve. At a national level, these stakeholders may include researchers at government agencies, and at a global level, they may include scientists at international research institutions. For the 14 major ecoregions, specific stakeholders may include representatives from local environmental NGOs, universities with research programs in the region, and government agencies responsible for managing the region's natural resources.

![](012.jpeg)

**Subjects**

Data scientists, environmental scientists, and biologists usually work in specialised or limited scientific fields and frequently lack the institutional clout or decision-making power needed to impact major projects like DestinE. Although their areas are relevant to Destination Earth's objectives, they are not sufficiently aligned to directly advance the project or make meaningful contributions. They have been categorised into this quadrant due to the fact that they often operate through institutions as advisors or members of teams that forward the research to other expert groups that have more power. Individual scientists in this field do not have much capacity, fiscal possibilities to have power as a single entity but as a collective they serve more as a connection between science and policy. 

This Group has a lot of potential to gain from DestinE, despite their small impact. Giving Subjects access to top-notch data and resources so they can further their studies and tackle novel scientific issues is one of the main value propositions. Furthermore, these stakeholders can be empowered to improve their abilities through customised capacity-building efforts, like workshops and training courses in high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), and digital twin technologies. Through the development of cooperative networks, DestinE can link these researchers with more prestigious organisations, increasing the impact and quality of their research.

**Players**

Climate scientists, meteorologists, ecologists, hydrologists, and important engineers are essential to DestinE's success and are included in the Players category. These stakeholders have significant influence over the project and show a high degree of interest in it. They frequently already participate in significant technical and research initiatives that directly support DestinE's goals, so they not only benefit from the platform but also help shape its future. Participants are in a unique position to spur innovation, direct the project's priorities, and guarantee that its results meet the most recent legislative and scientific demands, such those of the European Green Deal. The climate scientists, meteorologists, hydrologists and engineers in the relevant field have a strong influence on the project because they are often employed by consultant firms or political institutions to directly advise the policymakers and with their strong interest and knowledge and their close tie to the political institutions they are able to leave an imprint and influence the policy-making process. 

The value propositions for Players are made to empower and acknowledge their contributions because of how important they are. By collaborating to establish research goals and making sure they are in line with global issues, DestinE may provide these stakeholders with chances to influence the initiative's vision. Through early access to its infrastructure, information, and tools, DestinE can empower key stakeholders to lead innovation in their domains and develop new applications.

**Context Setters**

This category includes computer scientists, environmental economics, and interdisciplinary social scientists. Due to a discrepancy between their current focus and the main goals of DestinE, these stakeholders—who frequently work at the forefront of their respective fields—are not fully involved with the initiative. A social scientist might research societal resilience, for instance, or a computer scientist might develop algorithms for artificial intelligence, but their immediate interests might not coincide with digital twin technologies or climate science.

DestinE should highlight value propositions that align with their priorities and areas of expertise in order to get their attention. Cross-disciplinary incentives, for example, can show how DestinE's datasets and tools can address issues in their fields, including improving AI models or evaluating the socioeconomic effects of climate change. While demonstrating the compatibility of DestinE's data with external platforms might highlight its usefulness in a variety of applications beyond earth sciences, providing funding possibilities and encouraging collaborative research projects can encourage their participation. DestinE can increase its influence across disciplines and open up new synergies by fostering their interest.

**Crowd**

These stakeholders work in ancillary domains that are not closely related to DestinE's primary areas of interest. Even if they are currently not very involved, they could nevertheless use DestinE's data and capabilities for secondary or niche applications. For example, engineers may use DestinE's digital twin technology to solve certain technological problems, while agronomists could use its climate data to maximise crop yields. Engineers in a general sense and agronomists have neither much power nor interest in DestinE, they have no touch points with the topics and don’t have the power, neither individually nor collectively, to boost DestinE on a higher policy level or to bring it to broader attention.

1. #### <a name="_1al07814e2hb"></a>*Technology providers*
Technology providers, including companies that provide hardware and software solutions, may be interested in both providing tools and resources to support the development and implementation of DestinE and to use the tools and resources provided by DestinE for their own benefits. They may be interested in partnering with DestinE to provide data processing and storage solutions, as well as analytical tools and algorithms. Technology providers may be concerned about issues related to data privacy and security, as well as the potential for competition from other providers.

Technology providers may operate at all levels, from local to global. However, their services and solutions may be more relevant and tailored to specific spatial scales. For example, a GIS provider may focus more on local and regional applications, while a remote sensing technology provider may have a global reach. In the context of the DestinE project it may be more relevant to classify technology providers based on the services they provide rather than their spatial location. Ostensive the following are referred:
![ref2]![ref3]

- Geographic Information Systems (GIS) providers
- Remote sensing technology providers
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) providers
- Simulation and modelling software providers
- Visualisation and User Interface (UI) providers
- Cybersecurity and data privacy providers
- Cloud computing providers
- HPC providers
- Other software companies
- Hardware companies

![](014.png)

**Figure **5** Indicative technology providers subcategories**

Figure 5 shows indicative subcategories of technology providers. Unlike other stakeholder categories, technology providers do not have different subcategories on different spatial levels because their services are not necessarily limited to a specific geographic location. Technology providers can provide their services globally, and their solutions can be applied to various spatial scales. However, the specific solutions they offer may vary based on the needs and characteristics of different regions or ecosystems.

![](015.jpeg)

**Subjects**

- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS) providers:** Have the ability to visualise climate impacts, with comprehensive data sets from mapping and spatial analysis tools to inform adaptation and mitigation strategies. These providers may find the DestinE Platform useful to compare and contrast existing models and as supplementary support to their existing climate-related information.
- **Remote Sensing:** Utilise data to study and monitor the Earth’s surface and oceans, which can be used to inform adaptation strategies, observe existing threats and prepare for future challenges. Remote sensing offers a unique approach to climate change and companies and individuals involved in remote sensing data development may be inclined to interact with DestinE as a way to confirm or reevaluate their own analyses. 
- **Simulation & Modelling software providers:** Allow for experts to model cross-sector policies and strategies to better understand climate challenges and build a more resilient and sustainable society. These providers would want to use the DestinE Platform to reinforce their research and refine its performance in identified key areas.  
- **Visualisation & User Interface (UI) providers:** Allow for decision-makers and key stakeholders to plot and identify trends to better understand existing and future risks. This knowledge is important in the policy-making process and these providers would want the DestinE Platform to act as a complementary tool for visualizing climate-related impacts and outcomes.

- **Software providers:** Have the capacity to develop technologies and solutions that can inform climate solutions and influence policy decision-making. Software providers would most likely be interested in learning about the unique features and components within the DestinE Platform to guide their own activities and perform tasks more effectively. 


**Context Setters**

- **HPC:** High Performace Computing (HPC) companies provide systems that can be used to research and develop solutions to combat climate-related challenges. While there is high-demand across industries to integrate these services for breakthrough results, HPC companies may not be interested in the already existing DestinE Platform other than to learn from its unique components and potentially identify areas for collaboration. 
- **Cybersecurity and data privacy providers:** In the evolving and globalized digital landscape it is important to safeguard against data privacy threats and take the necessary steps to remain resilient to cyberattacks. Many sectors can become vulnerable to attacks when their company is suffering from climate-related challenges and consequences, therefore cybersecurity and data privacy provides may benefit from interacting with the DestinE Platform and gathering essential weather specific data to prevent attacks before they happen.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML) providers:** AI and ML providers have the ability to supply multi-functional tools, like predictive modelling and pollution monitoring, that can tackle complex climate challenges and be an asset in planning and climate strategy implementation. These providers may be interested in learning from DestinE Platform and interacting with the broad range of stakeholders using the Platform to assist the development or modification of their own tools. 
- **Cloud Computing:** Harnessing the power of cloud computing allows for decision-makers to gain more comprehensive knowledge about how to build a climate resilient world. Cloud computing is in high demand and companies are gaining political influence, they may only inspect the DestinE Platform to learn about how it functions and its specific capabilities.

**Crowd**

- **Hardware providers:** Can offer reliable tools to enhance productivity and output that can be used for climate change research and analysis. However, while hardware components and units may be inherently innovative, their influence and effectiveness is determined and validated by the types of integrations they have with software systems. DestinE Platform services may not provide the relevant data and capabilities to influence their development and business behaviors. 

1. #### <a name="_f3ilqqz6iql2"></a>*Industry*
Industry, including companies such as energy, agriculture, and transportation, amongst many others may be interested in using the data and insights offered by DestinE Platformto inform their operations and decision-making. They may be interested in understanding the impacts of climate crisis and extreme weather events on their business, as well as identifying opportunities for innovation and growth. Industry, although not necessarily one of the main beneficiaries, still has a lot to gain from the initiative, as a digital twin (or twins) of the earth could lead to innovations in risk management, insurance services, consulting, real estate, journalism and media, organisation, transport, and even other sectors where a benefit is less apparent.

Industry stakeholders may not be categorised based on different subcategories on a spatial scale, as their interests and operations are not necessarily confined to a specific geographic area. These companies may operate at a local, regional, national, or global level, depending on their industry and market reach. Many sectors could be interested and will be able to join the community. An indicative categorisation is shown in Figure 6 and listed below:

- **Energy and utility companies**: Those that may be interested in the potential impact of the climate crisis on energy supply and demand, as well as the opportunities presented by new weather forecasting technologies i.e., those involved in the production, distribution, and/or sale of energy, including those that work with fossil fuels, renewable energy, and nuclear power.
- **Agriculture and food companies**: Climate crisis will have a major impact on agricultural productivity, and companies associated with that may need to adapt to new conditions to maintain supply chains. Companies of the specific subgroup include those that produce crops, livestock, timber, and other related products.
- **Insurance and finance companies**: This subcategory contains companies that may be interested in the potential financial risks associated with climate crisis and extreme weather events. Examples of such companies are the ones that provide insurance against weather and climate-related risks, such as flooding, hurricanes, and wildfires.
- **Transportation companies**: Climate crisis and extreme weather events will have significant impacts on transportation infrastructure, particularly in coastal areas. Companies in this subcategory include airlines, shipping companies, and logistics providers.
- **Construction and real estate companies**: Construction and real estate companies that may need to adapt to changing weather conditions and sea levels, particularly in vulnerable areas. Such companies are the ones involved in the construction, maintenance, and management of infrastructure, including roads, bridges, airports, and utilities.
- **Consumer goods companies**: The specific subgroup refers to companies that may need to adapt to changing consumer preferences in response to climate crisis and extreme weather events, as well as potential supply chain disruptions. These companies may be the ones that sell products to consumers, including those that are focused on sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint.

**Subjects**

- **Consumer goods:** The consumer goods industry is a large sector, with global reach, that has the ability to influence consumer behaviors and supply to the marketplace. While company strategies impact sway demand and shape brand perceptions, they may not have the power to shift policy narratives and opinions.  Their production and distribution efforts can be strongly impacted by climate-related risks and consequences, meaning they would want to be informed about climate challenges, making DestinE a useful tool for preventing disruptions

**Players**

- **Energy and utility companies:** Can be classified as powerful due to their control over essential services and limited options for alternatives. This dependence gives these companies influence in top-down policy development and over regulations. Energy and utility companies would also have high interest in the DestinE Platform as climate change and extreme weather events can severely disrupt their operations and impact demand for services.
- **Insurance and finance:** DestinE is able to provide insurance companies with accurate predictive modelling and real-time data to spotlight potential climate related risks that would interfere with the capacity to serve households and businesses. Loss of land, impacted infrastructure and investments required for climate adaptation and mitigation heavily impact household financial security, government spending and the financial sector overall. Insurance and finance recommendations carry significant weight and influence as a result, influencing the ability of policy to drive transformational change.  
- **Agriculture and food:** Climate-related risks and challenges have and will continue to disrupt the agriculture and food sectors, interfering with traditional farming practices, eroding soil, damaging the health of habitats and perpetuating consequences for the food industry overall. The agriculture and food sectors control the food marketplace, giving companies significant political influence over the policies and regulations that govern our food systems. DestinE can serve the agriculture and food sectors with information to build resilient food supply chains and production processes. 

**Context Setters**

- **Transportation:** The transportation sector is a strong economic force as it connects goods, services and people, making it fundamental to advance local, regional and national infrastructure and development. As a result, the transportation sector maintains significant power in forming policy and regulations. Therefore, DestinE Platform services would provide significant value to the transportation sector to prevent disruptions in the movement of products and people. 
- **Construction and real estate:** Climate change and extreme weather events can interfere with construction productivity and real estate development, making the DestinE Platform an attractive tool for real estate developers and construction workers to ensure investment in secure environments and the protection of property developments, although their attention may not be completely dedicated to resilience and mitigation efforts at the moment.

<a name="_ref155974299"></a>**Figure **8**: Methodological approach to the development of the Community Building and Management Strategy**

Specifically, the steps in the development of the Strategic Plan include:

- Defining the vision and mission of the Community:

The first step in developing the Strategic Plan involves determining the guiding vision of the Community, which reflects the goals and values it seeks to achieve. Subsequently, the "Mission" of the Community is formulated, outlining the expected future state in accordance with the set vision.

- Analyzing and evaluating the current situation:

At this stage, the External Environment (PEST analysis) was explored, considering characteristics of the political, social and technological environment that can positively or negatively influence the development framework of the community. Information regarding the current internal environment of the community was then documented considering the characteristics and dynamics of the community that has been built so far and its further development. Subsequently, the analysis of the above information about the characteristics of the internal environment of the community fueled the application of SWOT analysis, aiming at the comprehensive exploration of the existing internal environment based on the identification of endogenous developmental characteristics and capabilities (strengths and weaknesses) compared to external influencing factors (opportunities and threats), respectively.

- Formulating Strategic Objectives, Priority fields, Actions:

At this stage, Short-Term Objectives (up to end of 2024) that require immediate achievement were set along with Medium - Term Strategic Objectives (up to end of 2026) and Long – Term Strategic Objectives (up to end of 2030). For each objective, priority axes, actions, and an implementation timeline were defined. 

|<p>*The current Community Building and Management Strategy will serve as the main guide to support the effective development of DestinE Community and its way forward to sustainability. This is a living document which will be updated as required during the DEUC project.*</p><p>*It is a dynamic plan encompassing a series of strategic actions designed to grow the community. This strategic approach ensures adaptability to contemporary technological, scientific and initiative related advancements, along with meeting the escalating demands of end users and benefiting entities.*</p>|

<a name="_toc172303005"></a><a name="_toc155973209"></a>**Values**

Establishing values within a community is crucial as it helps to define the community's identity and purpose, fosters unity and cooperation, encourages accountability and responsibility, provides guidance for decision-making, and enhances its reputation and trustworthiness. Along these lines, DestinE Users Community aspires to integrate the following values:

- **Sense of belonging**: The sense of belonging is an important aspect of any community, and it provides a number of benefits to its members. Members of the DestinE Users Community should experience this sense of belonging and feel comfortable to share their thoughts, take an active role in the community and contribute to its success. Moreover, the members of the community should be able to excploit opportunities for social connection and develop meaningful collaborations and partnerships with others who share common or complementary interests and values. Finally, the sense of belonging can increase motivation to participate in community activities and achieve shared goals. 
- **Co-design:** The active participation of DestinE Users Community members in the development and design of DestinE Platform is considered significant. Co-design in the DestinE Users Community aims to put users at the centre of the design process, ensuring that their needs, preferences, and feedback are collated and communicated effectively to the developers that oversee the final services. This will lead to more user-friendly, intuitive, and satisfying experiences. Being involved in co-design, members of the community will be able to experience a sense of ownership and investment in DestinE Platform evolution. It will also foster innovation and creativity by bringing together diverse perspectives and ideas. This can lead to novel solutions and approaches that might not have been possible with a more limited, top-down design approach.
- **Openness and transparency:** Openness and transparency are considered to be amongst the core values that the Destine Users Community aims to embrace. It is crucial to foster open communication and build trust among members. Members should be encouraged to share information and insights about their experiences, knowledge on a topic, and challenges with one another. Open and accessible channels for communication should be provided so as members can share their thoughts and ideas, ask questions, and get involved in discussions. Access to information, such as documentation, product roadmaps, and development plans, should be provided. When users provide feedback or raise concerns, it's important to be responsive and transparent about how their feedback is being used. Regularly sharing updates about the progress of activities, features, or services should be enforced to build trust and demonstrate a commitment to transparency. It is also important that members are able to see how decisions are being made and how their feedback is being incorporated. 
- **Diversity:** The DestinE Users Community aims to be welcoming and inclusive to individuals from diverse backgrounds, experiences, identities, and gender. To promote diversity and equality within the community, a code of conduct will be defined and made easily accessible to all members of the community and prohibit any form of discrimination and harassment. To encourage diversity and inclusivity in the community, members from different backgrounds and perspectives will be invited to join by promoting the community through various channels and ensuring that outreach efforts are inclusive. It is also important to foster an environment of mutual respect and support by encouraging members to listen to and learn from each other, as well as provide opportunities for members to participate and contribute to the community regardless of their diverse backgrounds, geographical or other differences. Additionally, the usage of gender inclusive language will be strongly promoted both in the discussions and activities (physical and virtual) and in the outreach and communication material. Moreover, it is significant to integrate inclusivity throughout the activities of user requirements and feedback collection to ensure that intersectional and diversity analyses are being mainstreamed into the design of DestinE Platform services.
- **Equity:** All members within the DestinE Users Community should have access to the same resources and opportunities for participation and engagement regardless of their background, identity, or socio-economic status, giving priority to stakeholders from EU Member States. Training and skill-building opportunities to members of the community who may face barriers to participation should also be considered as well as engagement in outreach and recruitment efforts to attract members from underrepresented or marginalised groups including targeted advertising that reach out to diverse communities. 
- **Sustainability:** DestinE Users Community should be sustainable and grow and evolve over time throughout DestinE initiative implementation and beyond. This requires creating a strong sense of community, ownership and fostering relationships between members. It requires also to empower community leaders to take ownership of the community and to continuously encourage community members to share their experiences and ideas through user-generated content. Collaboration among community members to foster relationships and create a sense of shared purpose should also be encouraged. Ultimately, a common online place for communication should be established and tools and guidelines for community management and uptake should be provided.

     1. ### <a name="_toc172303007"></a><a name="_toc155973211"></a>**External environment (PEST analysis)**
**Political:**

The political landscape, particularly driven by initiatives like the European Green Deal, provides a favorable environment for the development of a digital twin of the Earth. The commitment to climate neutrality and sustainable economic growth enhances the initiative's relevance and support. The alignment with Digital Strategy priorities further ensures that political backing facilitates transparency, accountability, and collaborative efforts between the public and private sectors, fostering an environment conducive to the initiative's success.

**Economic:**

The economic factors, shaped by recent crises such as the Covid-19 outbreak and geopolitical tensions, present both challenges and opportunities for the initiative. Economic uncertainties highlight the importance of the digital twin's role in providing a tool for modeling and simulating natural hazards, aiding in economic resilience. The initiative's success will be influenced by its ability to address economic concerns related to environmental uncertainties and contribute to stability through accurate adaptation strategies and mitigation measures.

**Social:**

The social fabric characterized by diversity and pluralism in Europe influences the initiative's development and adoption. EU policies on digital transformation and the reduction of social inequalities align positively with the initiative's goals. However, the challenge lies in managing the abundance of information accessible to EU citizens. The initiative's effectiveness will be influenced by its capacity to bridge the gap between information abundance and societal needs, particularly in the context of social dynamics and responses to natural disasters.

**Technological:**

Technological factors play a pivotal role in shaping the initiative's trajectory. Community contribution through voluntary data sharing is crucial for enhancing data quality, accuracy, and interoperability. While advanced technologies like AI offer opportunities, the initiative must navigate associated risks in cybersecurity and data protection. Compliance with EU legal frameworks ensures responsible technological integration. The initiative's success is contingent on its ability to adapt and leverage evolving technologies within the defined regulatory landscape, ensuring a secure and technologically robust digital twin.

1. ## <a name="_toc155973214"></a><a name="_toc203407382"></a>Short-Term Objectives – 2024	
Embarking on the journey to establish a thriving DestinE Platform by 2030, our strategic approach involves meticulous planning and the early cultivation of a vibrant community. Recognising the significance of community engagement in shaping the success of the platform and the initiative in general, we aim to lay the groundwork well before the initial launch – foreseen for 2024. To achieve this, a set of short-term objectives are outlined that focus on community-building initiatives and community members engagement to create a robust foundation for DestinE Platform’s launch but also laying the groundwork for a sustained, interactive, and supportive community that will propel our success well into the future.

**STO1 - Community Members base expansion to 3K by the end of 2024**

Presently, the community stands at a membership of 1,300+ registered individuals, symbolizing a community united by a shared commitment to fully exploit and advance DestinE Platform and DestinE. 

As we conclude the year 2024, we aspire to achieve significant growth, targeting 3,000 registered members within the DestinE community, assuming that there will be means to centralise data collection between the DestinE website (where the community is gathered) and the DestinE Platform (which would most likely be the first entry point for registering DestinE users). This numerical ambition is an estimation of our commitment to fostering a diverse and engaged community dedicated to advancing the DestinE Platform. The target of 3k registered users refers to the overall community i.e. both to those registered to the website being interested in being informed for DestinE evolution and to those registered to the DestinE Platform.

To achieve this strategic objective the following Priority Axes and actions are set.

**Priority Axis – PA1.1: DEUC Communities of Practice enabled**

<a name="_9y12bh7cmv1"></a><a name="_toc152171285"></a><a name="_toc139297763"></a>Communities of Practice (CoPs) CoPs are groups of people who share a common interest, concern, or passion and come together to learn from each other, solve problems and address challenges. CoPs can provide a place for individuals to:

- Share their knowledge, experience, and expertise with each other.
- Innovate and generate new ideas.
- Co-design, validate and promote products and strategies.
- Discuss and address common challenges together.
- Network and build relationships with others in their field, which can lead to new opportunities and collaborations.

In the context of the DEUC project, CoPs will be used to:

- Identify DestinE Platform user needs and preferences. By engaging with users through a CoP, it will be possible to get feedback on what features or functions are most important to them.
- Tap into the knowledge and expertise of individuals from different fields or industries. This can help the development of DestinE Platform that will meet the needs of a wide range of users.
- Test and validate the developed features and functionalities with the end users – which according to the feedback solicited can be refined to meet the user needs.
- Foster collaboration between individuals with different backgrounds and perspectives. This can lead to new ideas and approaches to DestinE Platform development.
- Support adoption and uptake of DestinE Platform.

This way, the needs and recommendations of different user groups will be better understood ensuring that the development of DestinE Platformis guided by the specific needs of the users, leading to more effective and impactful solutions. Moreover, the creation of CoPs will help to promote the wide adoption of DestinE Platform, as members of the CoPs become ambassadors for the platform within their respective communities.

In addition, CoPs can be exploited in the context of the work and projects carried out by the three Entrusted Entities (3Es): ESA, ECMWF and EUMETSAT in terms of joint participation in events, usage of CoPs activities to generate insights for 3Es’ work, organisation of joint events where all communities can work together etc.

<a name="_prg6q5jx5mcx"></a>**CoPs – Organic creation approach**

Recognising the existence of various communities already in fields related to DestinE initiative, our approach is to harness their potential and build upon their foundations. 

By tapping into established networks, expertise, and shared interests, we harness the collective potential of these communities to drive the formation of specialized CoPs. This organic formation of vibrant and self-sustaining CoPs ensures relevance, engagement, and collaboration while capitalising on the knowledge and relationships already present. By adopting this strategy, DestinE will create a strong foundation for the development of CoPs, enabling knowledge sharing, collaboration, and innovation to flourish.

Established communities often comprise individuals with significant expertise and experience in specific areas. By integrating these communities, we gain access to their collective knowledge, which can serve as a strong foundation for the formation of specialised CoPs. This approach ensures that CoPs are established with a solid knowledge base and have access to subject matter experts who can guide and mentor community members.

Moreover, leveraging existing communities helps ensure that CoPs are aligned with the interests and needs of participants. By involving community members in the formation process, we can leverage their input and feedback to shape the focus and direction of CoPs. This participatory approach increases the relevance of CoPs and encourages active engagement and contribution from community members.

In addition, the Use Cases to be procured within the DEUC project can lead to the creation of new CoPs covering various thematic perspectives related to the Green Deal and Digital Transformation.

Taking into consideration the two Digital Twins that are being developed, each CoP, will be discussing and holding activities that involve discussions regarding their themes in relation to Weather Extremes and Climate Change Adaptation. Within these, there will be a validation of existing DestinE Platform capabilities, as well as discussions on the design of future DestinE Platform capabilities ([**Figure 10**](#_ref134086258)).

<a name="_ref134086258"></a>**Figure **10**: Areas that CoPs activities may focus**

**CoPs set-up, operation and governance**

As DestinE is an ongoing endeavour, CoPs need to be inaugurated and commence their interactions before they develop and flourish into thriving hubs, centred around member interactions, offering opportunities for co-development.

Activities in 2024 focus on establishing the first set of CoPs. These may evolve from existing communities or emerge as new groups. Key activities \
during this phase include:

\
  **Onboarding Initial Members**: Recruiting participants who are passionate about contributing to the DestinE project through the DestinE Platform.
- **Developing a Collaborative Framework**: This framework will foster co-design with end users, emphasizing the importance of listening, empathy, and understanding diverse perspectives and needs.
- **Building a Foundation for Future Growth**: By slowly expanding the member base and activities, these CoPs will gradually contribute insights and recommendations to the DestinE project through DestinE Platform.

The operation of CoPs shall be supported by a governance model which has to be flexible and adaptable to the community's changing needs and circumstances as well as transparent and inclusive, ensuring that all members have a say in the community's activities. In the context of DEUC project each CoP may be led by a Community Facilitator, who will be responsible for facilitating communication and collaboration within the group. In case of existing communities, the Community Facilitator from DEUC project side will be responsible for facilitating communication and collaboration regarding DestinE Platform activities in accordance with the rules of each existing community and in consultation with the leader of that community. 

Members of the CoPs can be passive or active. A passive member can follow updates about DestinE activities and outputs. An active member can participate in the activities (co-design, user recommendations collection, hackathons, etc.), use and test DestinE services, propose topics of interest, share content and relevant work, as well as have access to a range of resources and tools, including webinars, online discussion forums, and training materials.

At the current stage of the DEUC project, anyone who is interested in applying for becoming a member of DestinE community can apply online via a dedicated form in the website (<https://destination-earth.eu/destine-community/become-part-of-the-destine-community/>).

CoPs are designed to function both physically and online. Physical operation of CoPs will take place via the organisation or participation in physical events. Online operation during 2024 will take place via online meetings (see PA1.3).

**Update July 2025**

In the context of Priority Axis PA1.1, efforts were undertaken in 2024 and 2025 to establish two Communities of Practice (CoPs), specifically focusing on Education.

The Education CoP was successfully established, and two initial engagement events were conducted. These events demonstrated positive early interactions, fostering discussions and exchanges among participants, and laying a foundational structure for continued collaboration. However, the continuity and further development of this CoP, along with the establishment of the second CoP focusing on Climate Modelling, encountered significant challenges. These challenges were primarily due to the limited maturity of the DestinE Platform, which hindered the ability to effectively sustain ongoing activities and interactions within these communities.

As a result, the further expansion and consistent operation of the Education CoP, as well as the formal initiation of the Climate Modelling CoP, have been temporarily postponed. Addressing the technical and functional maturity of the DestinE Platform remains a key prerequisite for resuming and fully realizing the potential of these CoPs.

Looking forward, and in alignment with the "D2.3 Roadmap for a wider DestinE system uptake," it is clear that the user community requires tailored actions for each target group. These actions must be informed by expected usage patterns, specific user needs, and sectoral relevance. Therefore, the establishment and continued development of CoPs remain highly meaningful. Efforts should be made in the coming years to ensure platform maturity, enabling these communities to effectively use   DestinE resources and significantly enhance user engagement and uptake.

**Priority Axis – PA1.2: Community engagement via organization of events and activities**

To enhance community engagement and foster growth, PA1.2 focus on organizing events and activities to create a vibrant and interactive environment. The aims is to host regular events tailored to the interests and needs of the community members to significantly boost participation and cultivate a sense of belonging. These events could range from webinars, workshops, to virtual social gatherings or collaborative projects. Additionally, incorporating interactive elements within events, such as Q&A sessions, polls, and networking opportunities, will ensure that community members actively contribute and feel valued. Leveraging various communication channels, including social media, newsletters, and dedicated event platforms, will amplify the reach and accessibility of the community events. Encouraging user-generated content or facilitating member-led sessions will also further empower the community. Ultimately, a well-curated calendar of events will be developed to enhance community engagement by providing meaningful and enjoyable experiences, creating a dynamic ecosystem that attracts new members and retains existing ones.

Update July 2024:

Activity 1 and 2 and activity A have been successfully implemented.

The originally planned activity schedule was impacted by a delay in the platform release. While the platform is now available, user registration is not yet functional. Due to this, implementation of community activities has been further delayed. This delay is twofold:

- Limited member experience: Community members expressed a desire to be able to see and interact with the platform functionalities before engaging in activities.
- Content creation dependence: Our team requires a fully operational platform to create and manage content for the planned events.

Update July 2025:

While the activities planned for 2024 had some success, particularly the initial events of the Education CoP, the planned Hackathon (Activity B) could not be implemented as intended. The Hackathon, designed to leverage DEUC project use cases, was contingent on these use cases' timely availability. Unfortunately, delays in the release of these use cases prevented the Hackathon from proceeding as planned. 

Moving forward, it will be crucial to synchronize the Hackathon and similar engagement events closely with the availability and maturity of the platform and relevant content.

**Priority Axis – PA1.3: Dissemination and communication**

The priority axis of "Dissemination and Communication" is pivotal in achieving the ambitious goal of reaching 3,000 members within one year. This focus underscores the significance of effectively conveying the community's mission, values, and offerings to a broader audience. Through targeted dissemination, the community can extend its reach, attracting individuals who align with its vision and creating awareness among potential stakeholders. Communication plays a key role in articulating the unique value proposition of the community, emphasizing the benefits of membership, and showcasing the vibrant ecosystem it offers.

An effective dissemination and communication strategy has been put in place already which involves leveraging diverse channels to engage with potential members. Regular and compelling content creation, such as blog posts, articles, and infographics showcase the community  and foster interest. Establishing partnerships, both online and offline, can also amplify the dissemination efforts, tapping into existing networks and increasing visibility. Ultimately, by strategically disseminating information and maintaining clear and consistent communication, the community can catalyze interest, draw in new members, and achieve the targeted goal of 3,000 members within the stipulated timeframe.

A Communication and Engagement plan has been put in place since 2023 and is detailed in Chapter 4 of the current document.

|**Actions**|**Timetable**|
| :-: | :-: |
|A1.3.1 Development and update of a Communication and Engagement plan.|2023 & 2024|
|A1.3.2 Regularly share engaging content, including community updates and upcoming events, to maintain an active and visible presence.|2023 & 2024|
|A1.3.3 Actively participate in relevant online forums and discussion groups and events/conferences to introduce the community to new audiences.|2023 & 2024|
|A1.3.4 Monitor and track performance of the activities.|2023 & 2024|

All activities outlined in PA1.3 have been completed and are now part of regular operations. The Communication and Engagement Plan gets updated whenever priorities shift. Community news, event updates, and outreach materials are shared across different platforms on a regular basis. Participation in both online and face-to-face events has increased visibility and expanded reach within the community. Performance monitoring continues to track communication effectiveness, ensuring messaging hits the mark and supports goals for community growth and engagement.

**STO2 - Enforce user interaction with** DestinE Platform **platform – reach 1K registrations by the end of 2024**

The year 2024 will witness the pivotal launch of the DestinE Platform. This event is a seminal moment, as our community transitions into a digital realm, providing a curated space for collaboration, connection, and the amalgamation of knowledge. By mid-2024, it is expected that user registration on the DestinE Platform will be enabled. This step represents an intentional effort to broaden our community's reach, inviting individuals to use and interact with the platform. The goal is set to reach 1K registrations to DestinE Platform platform by the end of 2024. It is not only about the platform's introduction but onboarding community members as DestinE Platform registered users. 

To achieve this strategic objective the following Priority Axes and actions are set.

**Priority Axis – PA2.1: Community members become** DestinE Platform **registered users**

|**Actions**|**Timetable**|
| :-: | :-: |
|A2.1.1 Develop a structured onboarding material to guide community members through the process of becoming DestinE Platform registered users.|2024|
|A2.1.2 Provide step-by-step tutorials, documentation, and support to ensure a seamless transition onto the platform.|2024|
|A2.1.3 Foster MOOCs uptake to familiarize members and users with DestinE Platform features and functionalities (linked to PA2.2).|2024|

**Priority Axis – PA2.2: MOOCs development and promotion**

|**Actions**|**Timetable**|
| :-: | :-: |
|A2.2.1 Develop MOOCs related to DestinE Platform platform functionalities.|2024|
|A2.2.2 Develop MOOCs related to the DEUC project use cases to increase interaction.|2024|
|A2.2.3 Implementation of a feedback loop to ensure learners feel supported and connected to the learning process.|2024|

Update July 2025:

The implementation of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) of the DestinE initiative could introduce to thousands of citizens around the world the DestinE project, its capabilities, its real data-based use cases, and simultaneously inspire and motivate users to create something of their own or present their already implemented work via the DestinE Platform. It has been proven worldwide that MOOCs, with their diverse content, including videos, quizzes, presentations, forums, and many more features, have helped users of other platforms and initiatives to understand, communicate, collaborate, and evolve both personally and collectively. 

This DestinE MOOC is structured in a way to cover all the basic features and points of the project, but also be open for updates and new entries as the project evolves throughout the years and with different contractors. In addition, this MOOC targets DestinE users who would like to deepen their understanding of DestinE's abilities and features and utilize them to grow through them. At the same time, this MOOC is open and accessible to people who are uninformed of the project, allowing them to learn about DestinE’s initiative, services, and Use Cases, and benefit from them. 

The development of the DestinE MOOC is structured into two modules/sections, representing the implementation of the Actions A2.2.1 and A2.2.2 of the PA2.2 plan. At the first module of the MOOC, named “DestinE explained: An introduction to the DestinE initiative and its mission”, the students will be able to know more about the DestinE initiative, its mission, its components, and the Entrusted Entities leading this project. At the same time, the students will understand the advantages, values, and objectives of DestinE, as well as its community, its services, and DestinE Digital Twins. . All these are explained via practical examples of using DestinE Platform, . This MOOC is further enriched in its second module/section, which hosts the description of the five Use Cases - Services implemented for ESA by several providers. Its provider prepared content, based on a prearranged common structure, to introduce their Use Case, explain its features, and showcase its integration to the DestinE Platform as a service. The purpose and key outcomes of each use case are presented to showcase the importance of their integration into the DestinE Platform. In addition, the data, methodologies, and tools used per Use Case are analyzed, following an analytical tutorial on how to use the developed DestinE services. The topics of these Use Cases include urban heat, urban planning, energy, flooding, fishery management, risk management, and polar voyage planning.

**STO3 - Develop and set a co-design framework within the community**

The approach of co-design keeps the individuals involved in any way in DestinE, close to its centre. These individuals, irrespective of their technical skills, bring to the table their personal expertise in their line of work, which is crucial for the holistic development and approach for DestinE.  From policy makers and first responders in climate change events who may share views on what kind of information is most important to view in case of emergencies and in what format, to research and academia personnel who can share how they may use the available data to conduct their research, and to developers of new products and services who wish to explore how to elevate available datasets into useful proposals and use cases, co-design is an approach that requires openness, acceptance of various views, transparency and a democratic mindset.

Though codesign can involve various depths of involvement of users in the design process, from simply inviting the sharing views, to citizen science and user generated decision making, the aforementioned users and stakeholders involved in various ways, by sharing views and recommendations with DestinE Platform developers, in regard to their needs and day-today problems. Following, DestinE Platform developers can prioritize and address whether these recommendations can become parts, capabilities, or features of the core DestinE Platform service, as it is being developed. However, it must be clear that the final decision making on which recommendation is implemented and to what extent, currently remains with the DestinE Platform developers, since they maintain a bird’s eye view of the entire development process.

Users and stakeholders share their input in this co-design process through organized and curated activities and tools, such as “User Stories”, sharing how they operate today and how they might operate in the future with the presence of DesitnE, “User Journey Maps”, sharing their activities and detailed steps of how they operate day to day, “Card Sorting”, sharing their preferences among preselected choices on specifically asked questions, taking part in to Q&As in Community of Practice (CoP) discussion sessions, responding to questionnaires as part of the CoP activities and casually exchanging views and viewpoints during the community’s networking activities.

Additionally, given the activity of existing communities of the 3Es, the DestinE community aims to reach out, involve and liase with these communities in its planned activities, as the project goal is universal and mutually beneficial. Within these activities, DestinE Platform developers are involved directly or indirectly in the interactions between community members and once each is completed, developers will be informed of the output and key interaction points through community feedback loops in post-event actions.

|**Co-design activities**|Community activities,<br>Ideation challenges|<p>CoP Activities,</p><p>Hackathons</p>|Recommendations formulation|

The identification of users and their engagement may follow the successful example of “climate services coproduction processes”[^2] i.e.:

a. Step 1: Establish the Why - High-Level Goal Conceptualization: To begin by focusing on the overarching goal or issue before diving into specifics. To consider high-level goals that may involve policy changes, attitude shifts, new collaborations, or empowerment.

b. Step 2: Identify the Where - Defining the Case: To define the specific context, recognizing the complexity of interconnected systems and various levels of influence.

c. Step 3: Determine Whom to Include - Stakeholder and User Identification: To identify stakeholders and users based on their relevance to the high-level goal. Consider participatory methodologies to dispel initial assumptions and ensure mutual learning.

d. Step 4: Select Which Attributes - From Stakeholders to Users: Το characterize stakeholders based on attributes like influence, power, and legitimacy. Determine their role in the coproduction process based on factors such as urgency, legitimacy, and knowledge types.

e. Step 5: Define Engagement Intensity: To determine the degree of involvement in the coproduction process based on attributes identified in Step 4. Tailor engagement intensity from awareness raising for all stakeholders to involvement for potential users and empowerment for final users.

**Priority Axis – PA3.1: Establish a co-design approach in community activities**

|**Actions**|**Timetable**|
| :-: | :-: |
|A3.1.1 Develop clear and concise guidelines that outline the principles and processes of co-design within the community.|2024|
|A3.1.2 Identify specific activities, features, or initiatives within the community that are suitable for co-design (linked with PA1.2)|2024|
|A3.1.3 Establish a process for recognizing and showcasing members' contributions to co-design activities.|2024|

**Priority Axis – PA3.2: Effectively communicate the community co-design results to** DestinE Platform **developers**

The establishment of a robust communication channel, where community recommendations are conveyed to DestinE Platform developers, directly influencing the trajectory of feature development is crucial for the community to fulfil its existence and role while ensuring that the platform is finely tuned to the evolving needs and aspirations of its user base.

|**Actions**|**Timetable**|
| :-: | :-: |
|A3.2.1 Establish a User-Feedback Approach/Protocol.|2024|
|A3.2.2 Provide an online place for users to share recommendations, insights, and experiences which will be shared with the DestinE Platform development team.|2024|
|A3.2.3 Provide regular updates on how user feedback is being processed, implemented, and contributing to platform enhancements.|2024|

Update 2025:

While the specific actions listed under PA3.1 and PA3.2 have not been formally implemented (the online forum is under development), community activities held throughout 2023 & 2024 served as vital sources of continuous user feedback. This feedback has been regularly collected and directly informed the recommendations presented in "D2.3 Roadmap for a wider DestinE system uptake." These user insights have been consistently communicated to the DestinE Platform development team through ongoing feedback loops.

As also highlighted in D2.3, co-design is a key area of interest and expectation for the DestinE user community. While foundational steps have been taken through community engagement, more concrete and structured objectives and actions are necessary to meet these expectations. These next steps are now more clearly articulated in D2.3 and are expected to guide future implementation efforts toward a formalized co-design framework within the community.
