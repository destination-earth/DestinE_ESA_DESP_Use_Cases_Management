# Introduction 

The ESA DestinE Platform Use Cases project (DEUC) includes the
production and maintenance of channels and promotional materials that
create visibility and support engagement for the wider Destination Earth
(DestinE) initiative within its workplan. This means that aside from a
promotional kit dedicated to DEUC, a promotional kit is also produced
for DestinE.

To support the production of these promotional kits, DEUC D2.2 Community
Building and Management Strategy and Workplan (CBMS) was used as input
specifically the sections on stakeholder analysis to ensure that the
messaging in these materials is relevant.

In addition, especially for the DestinE promotional kit, the materials
are undergoing continuous updating and submission under a review process
under the DestinE Entrusted Entities (3E) ECMWF, ESA and EUMETSAT as
well as the European Commission. This means that the produced materials
contain agreed joint messaging about DestinE.

This document covers the following:

- DestinE promotional kit

- DEUC promotional kit

- Training

# DestinE Promotional Package

This section contains the promotional package developed to generate
visibility and support engagement for the Destination Earth initiative.
This promotional package includes visual identity guidelines, brochure,
five stakeholder-focused flyers, poster, general slides, rollup banner,
and general videos.

In Q2 2024, the DestinE promotional package is expected to be updated to
consider three changes:

- The rebranding of RHEA to Starion Italia

- The renaming of the Destination Earth Core Service Platform (DESP) to
  the DestinE Platform

- A convergence on the term “Digital Twin” rather than “Digital Replica”
  or “Digital Model”

## Visual identity guidelines and branded templates

Based on the visual guidelines provided by the European Commission (EC)
which included mostly ways to use the logo, and how to show the funding
acknowledgement, the DEUC project developed an expanded visual identity
guidelines document with more suggestions for the logotype applications,
colour palette and fonts. An expanded guidelines document was needed due
to the development of other materials outside the EC that will need
guidance for logotype applications, colours and font.

The original files can be accessed in the following link:

<https://github.com/destination-earth/DestinE/tree/main/Promotion%20Packages/Visual%20Identity%20Guidelines>

In addition, and based on the visual identity guidelines, templates for
documents, letterhead and presentations have been delivered.

Following the 2<sup>nd</sup> iteration, the templates have been revised
and adjusted based on the received feedback. The changes included
improvements on the design and content distribution on the templates.
The presentation templates are currently under revision. The 5th
iteration of the templates is available at the following link:

<https://github.com/destination-earth/DestinE/tree/main/Promotion%20Packages/Document%20and%20Presentation%20Templates>

## Brochure

The DestinE brochure will supply more detailed information about the
initiative than what the other promotional materials can provide. For
the latest iteration of the brochure, it will have general information
about Destination Earth and its development, a page on each of the
components, who benefits from it, the known use cases to-date, and
engagement opportunities. This can be used at onsite events or can be
distributed digitally.

The current version of the brochure is to be considered complete for the
purposes of the first DestinE contract. The Serco contract will use the
version developed under the Starion contract as a basis to develop one
or more brochures which will be more lightweight in comparison to the
original, to ease the editorial and publication processes.

This can be accessed in the following link:

style="width:1.44826in;height:2.03182in" />

## Stakeholder-focused flyers

To supply stakeholder-tailored information, DEUC has produced a flyer
for each priority stakeholder group as identified in the DEUC D2.2
Community Building and Management Strategy and Workplan. Flyers tailored
to policymakers, decision makers, research and academia, industry and
private sector and technology providers have been drafted. These can be
distributed at digitally as well as onsite events where the presence of
specific stakeholders are expected, allowing promoters of DestinE to
supply stakeholder-specific information to audiences.

These flyers are now in their 3rd revision. The improvements include
changes in the flyers background to ensure readability, reflecting the
change in terminology from Core Service Platform to DestinE Platform,
harmonising the tagline of DestinE for the use of “digital twin” instead
of digital replica or model, and edits in the content to better
highlight the advantages for the stakeholders.

### For policymakers

The “DestinE for Policymakers” flyer aims to introduce DestinE to
policymakers and it highlights the various policy levels where DestinE
can be used. High-level information is supplied and seeks to pique
interest for the initiative from the target audience.

### For decision makers

The “DestinE for Decision Makers” flyer aims to specifically introduce
DestinE to decision makers. Unlike the other flyers, this specific flyer
is targeted to a specific role given DestinE’s significant benefits to
decision makers across various stakeholder groups. High-level
information is supplied and seeks to pique interest for the initiative
from the target audience.

### For industry and private sector

The “DestinE for Industry and Private Sector” flyer aims to generate
visibility on DestinE to the private sector. It highlights the benefits
to the private sector as a user, but it also informs them of procurement
opportunities where they can already take part in co-developing DestinE.
High-level information is supplied and seeks to pique interest for the
initiative from the target audience.

sessions, DEUC has developed a draft standard poster which can form the
basis of future iterations with more specific messaging, as needed.

The general poster has gone under revision and can be accessed in the
following link :

style="width:5.40787in;height:7.64687in" />

## Infographic

To support digital communication and engagement across websites or
social media, three infographics were developed to supply a one-page
overview or primer for DestinE. They are designed in a landscape format
that would be apt for consumption in desktop screens or laptops or for
easy incorporation into presentations. The infographics convey the
comprehensive construction of DestinE in an appealing and easily
digestible arrangement, assisting users with an enjoyable frame of
reference as they seek to educate themselves on the DestinE process.

These infographics can also be accessed in the following link :

style="width:6.26042in;height:4.42708in" />

## Presentation slides

To support promoters of DestinE in presenting the initiative at various
events, a standard presentation deck has been produced which includes
general information about DestinE and a default call to action to join
the DestinE community via the website. The slides are delivered in an
editable format to allow presenters to change the presentation according
to their needs. The slides have been further developed and are currently
undergoing editorial board review and a new iteration is expected.

## Rollup banner

DestinE-related events, particularly those organised by the Entrusted
Entities and their contractors that would like to further associate
their event to the DestinE initiative can use the rollup banner which
has been designed to not only reinforce DestinE’s visual identity but
also provide some high-level information and support the overall event
experience. This rollup has been approved and was used at events,
namely, BIDS’23, the 2<sup>nd</sup> DestinE User eXchange, and FOSS4G
2024, the QGIS User Conference 2024, the 3<sup>rd</sup> DestinE User
eXchange, EGI2024, and will be used at the upcoming 4<sup>th</sup>
DestinE User eXchange.

## Videos 

**DestinE Video Pill**

The DestinE Video Pill’s purpose is to introduce the Destination Earth
initiative to a general audience with a rapid overview of its objectives
and scope. The video uses stock footage of natural landscapes, digital
visualisations and laboratory environments to convey the themes of the
initiative to the audience while providing them with essential
information through a voiceover in tune with minimal text on screen.

The Video Pill was created using Powtoon editing software and has been
designed and edited following multiple exchanges with the EEs, starting
in July 2023. It has currently been archived and marked as complete for
the purposes of the Starion contract.

**DestinE Main Video**

The DestinE Main Video’s purpose is to provide a comprehensive overview
of the initiative to the public. It is expected to be valid for the
entire duration and be the flagship video for the initiative. As such,
the video does not limit itself to providing information but also uses
footage from the interviews with the EE representatives that were taken
during the 2nd UX event in Bonn, Germany to present an engaging and
personal message that can resonate not only with prospective DestinE
stakeholders but also the general public.

The Main Video was created using DaVinci editing software and has been
designed and edited following multiple exchanges with the EEs, starting
in October 2023. It has currently been archived and marked as complete

# DEUC Promotional Package

This promotional package is being used in DEUC-specific activities or
DEUC-organised events.

In Q2 2024, the DEUC promotional package is expected to be updated to
consider two changes:

- The rebranding of RHEA to Starion Italia

- The renaming of the Destination Earth Core Service Platform
  (<img src="./images/media/image2.png"
  style="width:6.25833in;height:1.99167in" />) to the DestinE Platform

## Visual identity guidelines

As it was necessary to distinguish wider DestinE-related promotional
materials and communication and engagement activities to those organised
specifically by projects run by contractors, a promotional package has
been produced that apply the visual identity of the DEUC project. The
visual identity guidelines were developed in a way that allowed DEUC to
associate itself to the wider DestinE initiative while visually
communicating that a specific DEUC activity was carried out through the
DEUC project and not the DestinE initiative nor the Entrusted Entities
collectively.

We have also updated the logo for DEUC to reflect the change from Core
Service Platform to DestinE Platform.

## General Poster

To generate visibility in relevant conferences or events with poster
sessions, DEUC has developed a draft standard poster which can form the
basis of future iterations with more specific messaging, as needed. This
poster has been displayed at the EuroGEO Week 2023 in Bolzano, Italy and
will be used at the upcoming EuroGEO Week 2024.

## EGU2024 Poster

Below is the poster for EGU 2024 aimed at highlighting the core
functions and purposes of DestinE, including the objective of the DEUC
project and its function as community engagement facilitator to gather
insights and recommendations from users and demonstrate the capacity of
DestinE infrastructure.

## Rollups

DEUC-organised events can use the rollup banner which has been designed
to not only reinforce DEUC’s relation to DestinE but also supply some
high-level information and support the overall event experience. Two
versions have been produced – one branding focused which only shows the
main value proposition of the project while a content-rich version
supplies more information about the project. A first version of this
rollup has been approved and was used at events, namely, BIDS’23 and the
2<sup>nd</sup> DestinE User Exchange. This roll-up will be updated at
the next opportunity where it will be used since, at present, the
current design still retains the outdated terminologies and logos.

This can also be accessed in the following link:

A general flyer has been produced to support DEUC in disseminating about
the engagement opportunities made available through the project. It can
be used at third party events where DEUC is authorised to distribute
promotional material.

## Presentation slides

To support the DEUC consortium in presenting its work at various events,
a standard presentation deck has been produced which includes general
information about DEUC and a default call to action to join the DestinE
community via the website. The slides are delivered in an editable
format to allow presenters to change the presentation according to their
needs.

The slides have been updated to reflect the consortium of the Serco
contract.

## User Story Forms

To properly collect user feedback during the 2<sup>nd</sup> User
Exchange, the consortium created a printable form with a series of
fields to categorise and understand user needs. The fields were aimed at
understanding Users’ professions and needs and their opinions on
DestinE. These have been used during the 2<sup>nd</sup> User eXchange.

They can be accessed through the following link:

## Zoom backgrounds for Webinars (PLUS THE OTHER MATERIAL)

To assist with the roadshow webinars of the Use Cases, the consortium is
creating a series of background images, consisting of a general
background for the speakers as well as an introductory background for
each webinar. So far, the general background plus the specific
background for the webinars have been created (CITYNEXUS, DRE,
UrbanSquare).

They can be accessed through the following link:

## 2<sup>nd</sup> User eXchange posters

To promote DEUC at the 2<sup>nd</sup> UX in Bonn, a series of posters
was realised. These were created by the Use Cases themselves rather than
by Trust-IT, but they are reported here nonetheless for posterity.

The posters can be accessed in the following link:

# Training

The DEUC project MOOC, at its beginning, will consist of two
modules/sections. The first module will stand as an introduction to the
DestinE initiative and its mission, while the second module will focus
on the introduction and explanation of the DestinE Use Cases of ESA,
implemented by esteemed providers. The target group of this MOOC is
mainly people unaware of DestinE’s services and use cases, but also
DestinE users who would like to understand and learn more about
DestinE’s capabilities and actions. This MOOC will be hosted at the
DestinE Platform Learning Hub, implemented by Serco. Trust-IT services
also created a presentation template for the DestinE MOOC to keep the
content uniform and well-structured throughout the various modules,
sections, and collaborating partners.

The first module of the MOOC, named “DestinE explained: An introduction
to the DestinE initiative and its mission” is going to help promote the
DestinE initiative, share and explain its components and advantages,
values and objectives, introduce the three Entrusted Entities
implementing the components of DestinE, help to grow the DestinE
Community, explain key actions on the DestinE Platform and its services,
and provide some practical examples of using DestinE Digital Twins.

 In parallel, the second module of the MOOC hosts the description of
five Use Cases implemented for ESA by several providers. These Use Cases
cover subjects over different sectors, including energy, fishery
management, flooding, polar voyage planning, risk management, urban
heat, and urban planning. Each Use Case represents a service that will
or is already integrated into the DestinE Platform. These Use Cases
showcase their impact and importance by making good use of the
capabilities that DestinE Platform offers. All providers prepared
content for the MOOC to introduce, explain, and showcase the implemented
Use Cases to DestinE Platform’s users or potential ones. The general
structure that is mostly followed throughout the content of the Use
Cases module is:

- Use Case’s overview, purpose, and key outcomes

- Description of data sources, methodologies, tools used, Use Case
  DestinE service, and analytical way of using it

During the recommendations gathering activities from the Community, the
following recommendations refer to training. Some of the recommendations
are under implementation and others will be addressed in the near
future.

# ESA DestinE Use Cases Promotion

Following the kick-off of the ESA DestinE Use Cases in November 2023, a
new website section has been released to provide a comprehensive
overview of the Use Cases. Prior to the launch of the section, all the
selected Use Cases have been contacted and asked to provide a
description of their work and expected impact following a template
confirmed with the three EEs.

All the Use Cases are showcased in the general section, where the user
can filter them by organisation, topic and scale. Additionally, each Use
Case has a dedicated page which gives information on the challenge
addressed, technical details, solution provided by each Use Case,
expected impact and the parties involved in the Use Case implementation.

To facilitate promotion and users’ engagement, the Use Cases pages have
been designed to incorporate multiple graphic materials provided by the
Use Cases and images referring to each Use Case topic.

The website section acts as the main point of reference for retrieving
information on the Use Cases.

All the Use Cases are accessible through the dedicated section at the
following link:
